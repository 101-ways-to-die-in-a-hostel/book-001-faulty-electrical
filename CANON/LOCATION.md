- Unique sounds: The specific buzz of Thai fluorescent lights, gecko chirps, the hostel's groaning plumbing

### Smells
- Hostel: Cheap disinfectant (lemongrass scented), mildew under everything, burnt rice from kitchen, someone's feet

- Specific to death location: Mold, chemical toilet cleaner, a hint of ozone even before the incident

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Bee (Busaba Sriwong)
**Description:** 24, perpetually tired night shift worker, studying accounting remotely, has seen everything, no longer shocked by farang stupidity
**Role in death:** Warning-giver - explicitly told Marcus not to charge in bathroom, was ignored

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Somchai Phan | 55, former fisherman, discovers the body, haunted by it |
| Security | None | Budget doesn't allow |
| Bar/Kitchen | None | Self-serve only |
| Manager | Khun Prasit | 60, owns the building, knows about electrical issues, decided repairs could wait |

### Staff Knowledge
Bee knows the electrical is bad - she's reported it three times. Khun Prasit promised to fix it "after high season." Staff whisper about a German who got shocked in 2019 but survived. There's an unspoken agreement not to discuss problems with guests or online reviewers.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Hungover zombies shuffling to the 10 AM breakfast deadline. Quiet except for someone's travel vlogging. Heat makes everyone sluggish. Locals selling tours pop in constantly.

### Night Vibe
Pre-game energy starting at 8 PM. Cheap buckets from nearby bars. Loud, sweaty, hook-up energy. Empties by midnight as everyone heads to clubs. Quiet again by 4 AM except for those too drunk to make it out.

### Guest Demographics
- 60% gap year British/Australian (18-22)
- 20% European backpackers (23-30)
- 10% American travelers
- 10% other (digital nomads, older travelers on a budget, people hiding from something)

### Reputation
**TripAdvisor:** 3.2 stars - "Great location, dodgy facilities"
**Hostelworld:** 6.8 - "Staff friendly but building falling apart"
**Word of mouth:** "It's cheap and you'll survive" (ironic)

4. **No charging devices in bathrooms** (CRITICALLY RELEVANT)

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Thai electrical standards differ significantly from Western (220V vs 120V)
- GFCI outlets not required by Thai code in older buildings
- Monsoon flooding is genuine annual problem in Khao San area
- Electrocution deaths in Southeast Asian hostels have occurred (research real cases)

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Avoid stereotyping Thai people as incompetent - frame issue as systemic/economic
- Thai staff characters should be three-dimensional, not just backdrop
- Address the power dynamic between Western tourists and local workers
- Don't mock Buddhism or Thai customs

### Sources
- WHO data on electrical safety in developing nations
- News reports on hostel incidents in Southeast Asia
- Thai building code documentation
- Backpacker forums for hostel details
