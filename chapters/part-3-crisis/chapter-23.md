# Chapter 23: Leak Path

He stepped into the bathroom like a man returning to a crime scene he had staged himself.

The puddle was thicker now, the water a shallow mirror that swallowed the light and made it look like the floor was not there at all. The ceiling leak had given up on dripping and started pouring in a steady, thin ribbon that hit the sink and splashed the wall in tiny, frantic arcs. The drain gurgled with the sound of a throat trying to clear itself.

Marcus set his laptop on the toilet lid, the same ritual he had performed twice already tonight. The lid was damp and wobbly, a cheap plastic hinge doing its best to pretend it was stable. He turned the laptop on. The screen glowed and the room felt, for a moment, like it was his office again, the bathroom tiles becoming whiteboard tiles, the dripping ceiling becoming a decorative fountain that he could reframe as “ambience.”

His email app opened with the smug speed of a machine that still had eleven percent battery left and no idea how vulnerable it was.

Subject: We saw your deck.

He stared at it. The sender's name was a sequence of letters and numbers, the kind of address that made you think of spam filters and auto-generated avatars. He wanted it to be real anyway. He wanted the universe to toss him a rope and call it “investor interest.” He clicked it.

The email was short.

We like the vision. Can you send a one-pager with updated traction? We move fast.

There was no signature. There was no firm name. There was no LinkedIn link. There was only the promise of speed, which in his world was a form of currency. He could smell the scam on it, but he could also smell the desperation on himself. The two odors mixed, indistinguishable from the bleach and the wet wiring.

He opened his notes app. He tried to summarize traction without laughing. He tried to make his churn sound like momentum and his runway sound like strategy. He typed a paragraph about “iterative learning.” He deleted it. He wrote “growth in emerging markets,” which meant “people in Bangkok clicked the landing page.” He added a bullet about “community-led retention,” which meant “his cousin still used the app.”

He knew he was lying. He had turned lying into a formal language a long time ago. He used numbers the way other people used metaphor. He watched the water creep toward the towel he had left, a soaked blue island now barely distinguishable from the floor. He stepped on it anyway.

The towel did nothing. It swallowed the water and became water. The damp soaked through his shoes and into his socks, and his toes went cold.

He needed to reply. He needed to send a PDF. He needed to charge. His battery ticked down to ten percent while he rearranged adjectives.

He looked at the outlet.

The outlet looked back. The crack in its plate was wide enough now to show a sliver of corroded copper inside, dark and wet, like a tooth. The hand-written NO CHARGING sign was face-down in the puddle, the ink bleeding into the water until the words were just gray veins. The wall around the outlet was damp, a dark halo that made it look bruised.

He touched the adapter. It was dry now, cooler. He lifted it like a tool he knew how to use. He told himself: two minutes. He told himself: only to finish this. He told himself: I can do anything for two minutes.

He plugged it in.

The outlet made a low, animal hum. The light above him flickered, not a full blink this time but a tremor, like the bulb had shivered. A tiny blue flash sparked inside the outlet. It was so brief it might have been imagination. It left an afterimage on his eyes.

He hesitated.

The smell of burning plastic bloomed for a second and then faded. It was just a whisper, a hint of a campfire that didn’t belong in a bathroom. He could have stopped. He could have unplugged. He could have waited until morning and let the email die in his inbox. Instead he told himself the smell was from outside, or the light, or the memory of a warning he could ignore.

He connected the cable to his laptop. The lightning bolt icon returned, bright and eager.

His fingers were steady as he typed the reply. He wrote:

Great to hear. Attaching a one-pager now. Happy to jump on a call today. Fast is good.

He attached a PDF he created in a hurry, a sheet of paper dressed as a pitch. The upload started. The WiFi bars were full, the strongest they had been all night, and for a moment it felt like the building was rewarding him.

The puddle swelled with the rain. The water curled around the legs of the toilet and lapped at the edge of the towel. His shoes were wet through now. When he shifted his weight, he could feel the water squeeze under the soles.

The upload stalled at 27 percent. He exhaled through his nose, as if patience was a feature he could enable. He watched the bar creep forward, pixel by pixel, and thought about all the times he had begged a progress bar to move: deploying code, rendering videos, waiting for his bank balance to load.

The bathroom light flickered again. This time it held a fraction too long, as if the bulb were deciding whether to die. The hum in the outlet deepened, a thicker vibration, like a bass note under the room. He felt it through the tile and into his calves.

He frowned. He didn’t like the feeling. He told himself he was being superstitious. He told himself sensations weren’t data. He told himself data was king. He told himself a thousand things that sounded like logic and tasted like fear.

The upload reached 60 percent.

His phone buzzed. A push notification. He ignored it. He was close. He was always close. He felt the way he felt before a funding call, before a demo, before a flight. The world constricted to a single task and everything else became noise.

A drop hit his wrist. He wiped it away without looking. Another drop hit the cable where it lay on the sink. It hissed. He looked down. The cable twitched, a tiny jump in place, and then lay still.

He imagined the electricity running through the cable like a river. He imagined himself standing in the shallows with his feet in the water and his hands on a live line. He imagined his parents’ kitchen again, the neat appliances, the outlets that never sparked. He imagined the warning sign in his mother’s voice.

He ignored it.

The upload hit 88 percent. He felt a surge of relief that was almost euphoria. He reached for his phone to check the time. 3:02 AM. The digits glowed like a countdown.

He finished the email and hit send. The client spun. The spinner spun. The spinner stalled.

The light flickered. A brighter blue flash flared from the outlet, more visible now, a brief tongue of light licking the air. He flinched and swore under his breath. The smell of burning plastic returned, stronger, sharp as a knife.

His heartbeat spiked. He froze, fingers hovering over the keyboard. The logical part of his brain screamed at him to unplug. The louder part insisted he wait just one more second. He felt that familiar split inside himself, the gap between caution and control.

The email went through. The spinner disappeared. Sent.

He exhaled. The relief was heavy, like he had been holding a weight above his head and finally put it down. He sat back on the sink and closed his eyes for a second. He could hear the rain on the roof, the drain’s sputtering, the hum in the wall.

He should have unplugged. He didn’t. He let the laptop charge, because it felt like buying time. The battery ticked to twelve percent. He watched it rise, the tiny numbers like a stock price he could affect.

He opened X while he waited, because he needed to do something with his hands that wasn’t reaching for a live outlet. His feed was the usual mixture of founders hyping themselves and crypto bros trying to sell each other a future that never arrived. He scrolled.

A post from @HostelReaper slid past, a photo of a travel adapter on a wet sink. The caption read: 

Never trust an outlet that hums. It’s humming because it’s hungry.

It had 4,000 likes and a hundred comments of people laughing and tagging friends. He paused, thumb hovering, and then kept scrolling. The algorithm loved dread when it was packaged as content.

He stared at the screen, the irony unspooling in his head like a slow joke. He was in a wet bathroom in Bangkok, plugged into a humming outlet, reading a post about humming outlets. He almost laughed. The laugh died in his throat.

He checked his email. No reply yet. He closed the tab.

The outlet hummed louder. The light above him flickered again. He felt a slight tingling in his fingertips, like the faint prickle of static after sliding across a carpet. He lifted his hands and flexed them. The tingling faded. He told himself it was nerves. He told himself he had been up too long.

He decided to leave. He stood and shifted his weight, and his right foot slipped. The puddle had slicked the tile beneath the towel. His shoe slid a half inch, and his ankle twisted. He grabbed the sink to steady himself. His palm pressed against the damp porcelain.

A sharper sting shot up his arm. It was brief but unmistakable, like a thin wire flicking across his skin. He jerked back, eyes wide, and knocked his laptop slightly. The cable tugged. The outlet buzzed. The light flickered. The sting lingered in his palm, a pulse of heat.

He stood still, breathing hard. The sting faded. He stared at his hand. There was no mark, no burn. He felt the room breathing around him, electrical and wet.

“Okay,” he whispered. “Okay.” He said it like he was talking to a wild animal. He reached for the adapter, this time with the towel, and pulled it out.

The hum stopped. The light steadied. The room felt quieter, emptier, as if something had left.

He unplugged the laptop and tucked the cable away with shaking fingers. He set the laptop under his arm and stepped back toward the door, careful now. The towel slid under his feet like a tired apology. He stepped off it and put his weight on the driest tile he could find.

In the hallway, the air felt cooler. He leaned against the wall and closed his eyes. He had an irrational urge to laugh, to cry, to call his mother, to tweet about resilience. He did none of those things. He just breathed.

The light in the hallway flickered. The building was a vein, and the power was irregular, pulsing like a tired heart. He could feel his own heartbeat echoing it. He told himself it was nothing. He told himself everything was fine.

He walked back toward the dorm, but he didn’t go inside. The mattress was damp. The air was stale. His mind wouldn’t stop. He sat on the stairwell instead, the concrete cool against his legs.

From here he could see into the common room through the open doorway. The couches were a drift of sleeping bodies, bare feet and tangled hair, people folded into themselves like used clothes. A girl had her arm around a pillow, hugging it like a raft. The neon beer sign cast a red glow over everyone, making their skin look flushed and raw. The bar fridge ticked on and off, a tired heartbeat. The bucket under the leak was almost full, water plinking into it at a rhythm that would have been soothing in a different life.

He thought about going down to the kitchen for water. He pictured the communal kitchen as it had been earlier: the hot plates with burn circles, the jar of instant coffee labeled DO NOT STEAL, the travel tips board covered in faded flyers. He could taste the coffee already, bitter and thin. He stood, half-decided, then sat again. He didn’t want to walk. He didn’t want to talk to anyone. He wanted the world to stop asking him for effort.

His phone screen lit up with a vibration against his palm. It wasn’t the email yet. It was his LinkedIn post, the one he’d thrown into the void an hour earlier. Someone had liked it. Someone had commented.

Great hustle! Love the grit.

He stared at the comment, the cheery font, the little avatar of a man he had met once at a conference in 2019. The compliment made him feel worse. It took his damp, messy reality and turned it into a motivational poster. He wanted to reply with the truth: I am sitting on a stairwell in Bangkok and my laptop smells like plastic. I am one flicker away from losing everything. Instead, he tapped a thumbs-up emoji. The act felt like paying a tax.

He scrolled. A meme about “founders sleeping in airports” floated past. A thread about “how to build resilience” wrapped itself around a photo of a man in a Patagonia vest. A venture capitalist posted, ironically, about “founder safety” after a retreat in Bali. He shut the app.

He could hear the building with a clarity he hadn’t noticed before. The pipes weren’t just groaning; they were thrumming, as if water and electricity were arguing inside the walls. There was a faint, constant buzz, like a refrigerator coil, only lower, deeper. The hostel felt like a machine that no one had turned off in decades. A tired machine, hot and overworked.

He stood and walked down the stairs, stopping halfway to glance at Bee. She was asleep on the front desk couch, her hair falling over her face. The mop bucket beside her held a gray puddle, the mop itself leaning like a question mark. There was a small shrine on the desk—an elephant figurine, a garland of wilted jasmine, a tiny bowl of water. The bowl trembled with each drip from the ceiling. Her phone buzzed once and went quiet. She didn’t move.

He felt a flicker of guilt. He had treated her like a firewall in his way. She was just a tired woman on night shift in a building that didn’t care about any of them. He watched her for a moment, then moved past her toward the courtyard.

The courtyard was cooler, the rain softened by the awning. The smell of wet concrete and fried oil was stronger here. The cat was still there, watching him. It didn’t move as he stepped out. Its eyes were coins.

He leaned against the wall and looked up at the strip of sky visible between buildings. The rain was a sheet, the sky a gray smear. Power lines crisscrossed overhead like drawn wires, water dripping from them in small beads. In the distance, a transformer arced with a bright blue flash, a brief strobe that lit the alley. He heard the crackle a second later, a dry snapping sound. The city was electrified in a way that felt alive and precarious.

He thought about his parents’ neighborhood, the quiet hum of underground lines, the way the lights never flickered. He had taken that stability like oxygen. He had moved into places where the infrastructure was visibly improvised and treated it like a novelty, like a quirk of his personal brand. A grittier life for the story, he had told himself. The story was now biting.

He imagined the person who sent the email. Maybe it was real. Maybe it was not. Either way, it didn’t care about his environment or his wet shoes or the way the outlet hummed. The internet did not hear that hum. The internet would keep requesting things, drawing current like a demand.

He returned to the stairwell, damp again, and sat. He rested his head against the wall and closed his eyes for a moment, trying to slow his breathing. His heart had a jittery edge to it, a slight arrhythmia of anxiety. He pressed two fingers to his wrist and counted the beats. Seventy-two. Seventy-eight. Seventy. He told himself to ignore the irregularity. He told himself his body was a machine and machines could be optimized.

His legs tingled, a residual static that wasn’t quite pain. He flexed his toes inside the wet shoes. The socks clung to his skin. He was uncomfortable in the way that felt like punishment rather than inconvenience.

He looked at his laptop. The lid reflected the stairwell light, an off-white shine. He ran a finger along the edge and felt a slight warmth. It smelled faintly of the bathroom—bleach and plastic and something metallic. He pictured the cable, the outlet, the water. He pictured his hand slipping, his foot sliding, a thousand tiny disaster simulations. He told himself he was overthinking. He told himself he was right to be cautious. He told himself both things at once.

He took the laptop to the common room and set it on the coffee table. He didn’t turn it on. He just looked at it, the way you look at a sleeping animal to see if it is breathing. He touched the top of the lid. Warm. He imagined the battery as a dwindling fuel gauge on a plane, the runway lights far away.

He went to the kitchen and poured himself a glass of water from the plastic jug in the fridge. The water was warm, the fridge barely cold. He drank anyway. It tasted faintly of plastic and metal, as if it had learned the pipes by heart. He refilled the glass and poured it into the sink, rinsing it of nothing. The sink gurgled and burped. The building didn’t want anything in its drains tonight.

The hallway outside the bathroom was darker now. A light farther down the hall had burned out, leaving a pocket of shadow. The bathroom light still buzzed, a steady, stubborn sound. He could feel it in his teeth, the way the buzz rattled a filling.

He returned to the stairwell with his water and sat again. The drink did nothing. He felt the weight of the email and the numbers and the fact that he had to respond in some way that didn’t make him look like a fraud. He had spent years making himself look like the opposite of a fraud. The work of it felt heavier than his laptop.

His phone buzzed. A reply.

Thanks. We’ll review. Can you jump on a call tomorrow? Also, can you send bank statements to verify runway?

He stared at the words. The rope, if it was a rope, had turned into a noose. He could feel his chest tighten. Bank statements. Verification. The word “runway” used like a weapon. He imagined a faceless investor, or a scammer, or both. He imagined the humiliation of sending statements that showed the kind of numbers that didn’t belong in a pitch deck.

He closed his eyes. The rain drummed on the roof. The hum of the building crept into the stairwell. He could still smell the ozone on his hands.

He had a choice. He could ignore the email. He could sleep. He could wake in the morning and decide. He could stay offline and pretend there was no cliff.

He opened his laptop.

The battery was at thirteen percent now. It blinked as it connected to the weak WiFi in the stairwell. He tried to open his bank app. It loaded halfway, then froze. The WiFi bar dropped to one.

He swore softly. The bathroom would have better signal. The bathroom always had better signal. It was like the building was funneling all its remaining goodwill into that damp box, a cruel little gift.

He told himself no. He told himself he didn’t need the email. He told himself he could wait until morning and use a cafe. He told himself a thousand no’s and then stood up and walked back down.

The hallway to the ground floor was darker now. The front desk lamp was off. Bee had gone to sleep on the couch, her head on her folded arms. Her phone screen was dark. The mop bucket sat beside her like a sleeping animal. The building felt abandoned, its noises now private: plumbing groans, the occasional click of a relay, the rain whispering against the roof.

He moved toward the bathroom door. He hesitated with his hand on the handle. The door felt cool and slightly sticky. He could hear the faint buzz inside, the light arguing with itself. He could smell the bleach and the damp. He could almost smell the hot plastic again.

He told himself: Just to check. Just to see if the WiFi is still strong. Just to send one more email. Just this once.

He opened the door.

The puddle had expanded to the threshold. The water met his shoe, cold and soft. He stepped inside anyway, the towel gone now, no dry island left. The floor was all water. The light buzzed louder. The leak had become a small stream. The drain gurgled like a stomach.

He set the laptop on the toilet lid and stood, both feet in the thin water, the leather of his shoes absorbing it like sponges. The water felt colder than before. It crept up the sides of his soles. The tiles under the water were slick, and he could feel the slightest vibration of the building through the puddle.

He opened his bank app. It loaded. The numbers appeared, small and shameful. He stared at them and felt his stomach drop. There was no runway. There was a runway-shaped idea, and then there were numbers that did not match.

He needed to take a screenshot. He needed to send it. He needed the laptop to stay on long enough. He looked at the battery: eleven percent.

He looked at the outlet.

The outlet looked back.

He could hear Bee’s voice in his head. He could hear the German guy. He could hear his mother. He could hear @HostelReaper’s caption. He could hear all of it, and none of it was louder than the simple fact that his laptop was dying.

He reached for the adapter.

His hand hovered in the air. The skin on his fingers prickled, a phantom tingle. The light above him flickered. The room hummed. The puddle trembled, a thin ring rippling outward with each drop from the leak. His shoes were soaked. The water had found the seams.

He told himself: I’ll be quick.

He told himself: I’m not barefoot.

He told himself: I’ve done this already.

He plugged the adapter in.

The hum deepened. The light fluttered. A faint blue flash sparked inside the outlet. He held his breath. He plugged the cable into his laptop. The lightning bolt icon appeared like an accusation.

He opened the email reply and attached the screenshot. He watched the upload crawl forward. He felt the water around his feet, cool and constant, and he felt the electricity in the air, a pressure like a storm about to break.

The upload stalled at 41 percent.

He tapped the trackpad. He waited. He tapped again. Nothing.

The light flickered. The outlet buzzed. The smell of burning plastic rose. He hesitated, fingers frozen on the keyboard. He could stop now. He could unplug and walk out. He could let the email die. He could preserve himself.

He watched the progress bar move, one pixel at a time. It reached 42 percent.

He whispered, “Come on,” like the laptop was a friend instead of a machine strapped to a live wire in a puddle.

The progress bar crept to 43. The water around his shoes shimmered with the flicker of the light. He felt a faint tingling in his calves, almost a vibration, almost a warning. He shifted his weight. The water rippled.

He stayed.

He told himself: Just this once.

The upload reached 45 percent.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. He ignored it. The buzz felt distant, a tiny echo to the buzzing in the wall.

He was still standing in the puddle. He was still holding the laptop. He was still plugged in.

And he was not done.
