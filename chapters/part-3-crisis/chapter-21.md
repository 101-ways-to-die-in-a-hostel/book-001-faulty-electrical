# Chapter 21: Voltage Drop

His power bank died in the exact moment it was supposed to save him.

The little gray brick blinked green, then amber, then nothing, like a traffic light going to sleep. Marcus stared at it, thumbed the button again, held it down, the way you did when you wanted a machine to try harder. It did not try harder. It went still and smooth in his palm, the only heartbeat in the room belonging to the rain.

The common room had thinned out since his call with his mother. The glitter-cheeked girl was gone. The monkey story guy had migrated to the stairs, half asleep against the railing. The bucket under the leak had become an instrument in a slow rain percussion. The fluorescent tube above him kept buzzing in a way that made his teeth hurt.

He looked at his laptop. Twenty-seven percent. The icon in the corner pulsed a small, polite red. It might as well have been laughing.

He did the math without doing the math. Twenty-seven percent meant maybe an hour of active use. Less, if the WiFi kept forcing the radio to spike. Less, if he had to open the video call he was trying to avoid. He hadn't responded to Jonah's last message. The thread sat in his inbox like a ticking code review.

He thumbed through his bag. The bag was a ritual of business travel: spare cables, a multiport hub, three travel adapters, no humility. He found another cable. He found the one with the fraying sheath, the one he always meant to replace but never did because it still worked. He plugged it into the dead power bank anyway, as if a different cable could wake a different battery.

It did not.

The rain surged, louder. The hostel's power hiccupped. The lights dimmed for a half second, every screen in the room flickering with them. He felt the building breathe and realized how much of his mood depended on the stability of the current. The world dimmed. His confidence dimmed with it.

Across the room, a British guy with a shaved head yelled, "Oi, who keeps plugging in the kettle?" and someone else yelled back, "It's not even working." Laughter rippled. It was the kind of laughter that shows up when people can't do anything else.

Marcus opened his laptop and tried to tether. The WiFi light in the corner of his screen flipped on, then off, then on, like it couldn't decide whether to acknowledge his existence. He tried again. He watched the spinning wheel. It spun like a roulette wheel. It landed on no signal.

He stood and looked for outlets like a man scanning a room for exits. The common room had four, all on the same wall, all in the same strip of damp concrete under a hand-painted sign that said PLEASE NO HAIRDRYERS. Two were occupied by chargers and a bar fridge with a gasping motor. One had a plug so loose it hung at a lazy angle, the adapter half-falling out of its own humiliation.

He crouched and pulled the power strip out. It was a cheap one with a cracked casing and a red switch that was supposed to be a surge protector. He clicked it off. Everything in the room sighed. The bar fridge stopped humming. The laptop across from him went dark and someone swore. He clicked it on again quickly, a reflexive reboot, and the world restarted with a whine and a pop. He felt a small jolt in his fingers and lied to himself that it was static.

"Sorry," he said, more to the room than to anyone. Nobody looked up. He plugged his power bank into the strip anyway. The green light did not return.

He could hear Ruth's voice in his head: The universe doesn't give you practice shocks. It sounded like a meme, the kind of phrase that would get liked by people who'd never been electrocuted. It still stuck.

He opened his inbox. Jonah's last email was two lines.

Call me. This is urgent.

The time stamp was two hours ago. Marcus read it like it was new, like urgency hadn't been part of his life for the past year.

He tried the WiFi again. It connected in a sudden, miraculous burst. He clicked send on a draft he had been saving, a three-paragraph non-answer to a question about runway. The spinner appeared. The spinner kept spinning.

Then the connection died.

He sat back, the chair creaking. He was aware of his own breathing in a way he hated. He was aware of the stickiness on the chair's vinyl seat, the film of humidity that never let you forget where you were. He was aware of the faint smell of bleach coming up from the tiles. The room looked the same, the same sad couches and chipped coffee table and neon signs. But the air had changed. It felt heavier, like a storm was gathering inside the building and not just outside.

He looked at his phone. Forty-five percent. Enough for a call. Not enough for everything else. He opened his calendar. The meeting with Jonah was slotted for midnight. In eighteen minutes.

His laptop had enough battery for one shot. His phone had enough for a call but not enough for a screen share. Jonah had asked for the deck. He had asked for the updated numbers. He had asked for proof that NomadSync was still alive. Marcus had no proof. He had a PDF and a belief system.

He needed WiFi. He needed power. He needed the world to obey his timeline.

He stood up and walked to the front desk.

Bee looked up from her phone, unamused. Her hair was in a messy bun, the same bun she'd had an hour ago, a day ago, a week ago. The mop leaned against the wall like a spear.

"Need WiFi," he said.

She pointed at the ceiling. "Same WiFi. Sometimes good, sometimes not." She said it without blame. It was weather, like rain.

"Is there a router I can reset?" He kept his tone friendly, the way he would in a customer support chat. He even smiled.

She snorted, the first time she'd done so around him. "You want to reset?" She nodded toward the hallway. "Router there. Locked. Manager sleep. You can wait until morning." She glanced at his laptop and then at his eyes. "Or you can go bathroom. And you know my answer."

He opened his hands, an empty gesture. "I'm not going in the bathroom. I'm just trying to make a call."

"Call on phone," she said.

"I need to share a screen."

She shrugged. "Not my problem."

He wanted to tell her it was her problem too, that the hostel would be in every place he reviewed, that he had influence, that he had a network. He didn't. The idea felt childish in his mouth. He was a man in a damp room asking a tired woman for a reset button.

"If I could just get into the router cabinet," he said.

"No." She set the phone down. "Do not touch. We had one guest touch once. Whole floor no power. You fix? You pay?"

"I can fix," he said.

"You cannot," she said. The certainty of it hit him harder than any shock. "You are not electrician."

He almost laughed. He had never claimed to be an electrician. He had built products. He had built hype. He had built himself a persona that assumed everything was hackable if you had enough logic and a clean enough whiteboard. He was now standing in front of a locked cabinet full of wires, being told no like a child.

He stepped back. "Fine."

Bee went back to her phone. He lingered a second longer, staring at the mop water bucket. The bucket was full of gray water with flecks of dirt. It smelled like a failed promise. He could see his own reflection in the surface, warped by the ripples. It looked like him if he stayed here too long.

He retreated to the common room and opened his laptop. Twenty-three percent. The battery had been draining even while he argued. He typed "Bangkok cafe open late WiFi" into his phone and got nothing but a loading wheel that spun as slowly as the ceiling fan. The rain had choked the data.

He stared at the map that would not load and the calendar that would not move and the laptop that would not charge. He thought of the bathtub of his parents' Palo Alto home, the immaculate house with outlets that never sparked. He thought of being fourteen, watching his parents divide a bookshelf, the power still on while everything else split. He thought of the story he had been telling himself: that he was building a life that didn't depend on anyone. The story was a lie and it was leaking like the roof.

He looked around the room again. The common room was a dead zone. People were sleeping in chairs, slumped on couches, faces lit by the blue light of their phones. The energy had turned inward, selfish, survival mode. He could not borrow power from them. He could not borrow WiFi.

He checked his watch. Twelve minutes.

He grabbed his laptop and walked toward the stairwell. If the WiFi was better in the bathroom, maybe it was better on the stairs. He could sit on the landing, away from the puddle, away from the outlet, and get a bar of signal. He could do it without crossing the line.

He climbed to the second floor, where the hall smelled like socks and citronella. A gecko clicked somewhere in the dark. He sat on the landing and opened his laptop. One bar appeared. He smiled and started to connect.

The bar vanished.

He tried again. Nothing. The router's signal was a rumor. He looked down the hallway and saw the light in the second-floor bathroom flicker, faint and unreliable. The door was propped open with a flip-flop. The tiles inside reflected a thin sheen of water.

He stood. He told himself he was checking for signal, not going in. He walked toward the door and stopped just outside, feeling the damp air on his shins. The smell hit him: bleach, mildew, and the faint metallic tang of wet electricity. The same smell as the common room outlet, only stronger.

He didn't step in. Not yet. He opened his laptop at the threshold. One bar. It held. A page loaded. He sent a test email to himself. It went.

His heart lifted. The signal was here, just outside the bathroom, in the wet hall where no one else wanted to be. He could make this work. He could sit right here, back against the wall, and send his deck. He could avoid the outlet. He could avoid the puddle.

A door opened behind him. A German guy with a towel on his head stepped out of the bathroom, dripping. He stopped when he saw Marcus sitting on the floor with his laptop like a shrine.

"Dude," the guy said. "That's gross." He gestured at the water. "You're gonna get schock, yeah?"

"I'm not in the bathroom," Marcus said.

The guy laughed. "It's all bathroom. Everything wet."

He stepped over Marcus and went to his dorm, leaving a trail of water like a breadcrumb warning. Marcus watched the water slide across the tiles and felt the edge of the wet touch his own shoes. He lifted his feet.

He opened his email. The message to Jonah was still in drafts. He attached the deck. The upload progress bar crept forward, slow as a sunrise. His laptop fan spun, a tight little whine. The WiFi bar dropped to zero.

The upload stopped.

He stared at the frozen bar. He waited. Nothing.

He swore under his breath and closed the laptop. His battery was at nineteen percent now. Time was at nine minutes. He needed a stable connection, not a fragile hallway near a bathroom he was pretending not to use.

He went up to the third floor, because why not. The third floor was louder, the party room still awake despite the late hour. The door to Room 301 was open and music thumped from a phone speaker. The air smelled like rum and sweat. He pushed past a group of Australians arguing about where to find food.

Inside, the air was hot. A guy was sleeping on the floor under his bunk. A girl was braiding another girl's hair, the braid a slow, patient ritual amid the chaos. Marcus perched on the edge of his bunk and opened his laptop. No signal. The party room was a Faraday cage made of cheap concrete and bad decisions.

He left and went up to the rooftop, because if you wanted signal you went higher. He pushed open the door to the roof and the wind hit him like a slap. The rain had slackened to a heavy mist, and the city below was a neon ocean. The wires on the street poles made a black web against the sky. A transformer on the corner was arcing, blue flashes that lit the rain like camera strobes. The sound was a low, angry crackle.

He stood under the roof overhang and held his phone up, arm extended. One bar. Two. He tried to connect the laptop to his phone's hotspot. The phone tried to connect to the internet. The hotspot spun. The laptop spun. Everything spun. Nothing caught.

His shirt clung to him. The air was thick and tasted like diesel and wet concrete. A tuk-tuk engine revved below, its exhaust belching upward. The neon reflected in the puddles, making the street look like it was bleeding colors.

He thought about his deck, about the clean white slides, the unit economics, the hockey-stick graphs that no longer matched reality. He had put so much of himself into those slides that they felt like him. He couldn't let them die on a bad connection.

He looked at the arcing transformer again, the way the light jumped and faded. It reminded him of the outlet in the bathroom. The same electric blue, the same brief strobe. He felt a familiar chill in his arms, a ghost of the surge from earlier. He left the rooftop.

He went down to the second floor again and then to the ground. The common room was darker now, most people asleep. The bar fridge had stopped entirely. The power strip light was off. He looked at it, confused, and toggled the switch. The strip clicked. Nothing happened. He pulled the strip out of the outlet. The outlet was warm. The plastic plate had a new scuff mark, a thin black crescent like a burn.

He held his hand near it. He could feel a faint heat, as if the wall itself was feverish. He pulled back. He wasn't stupid. He was just stubborn.

He checked the time. Six minutes.

He did what he had been trying not to do. He went to the bathroom.

The ground-floor bathroom door was closed. The hand-written sign was still taped to the wall next to the outlet inside, the letters smeared from being wet and dried and wet again. He opened the door and was hit by the damp heat, the way a cheap sauna hits you with the smell of mold and bleach. The floor was wetter than it had been an hour ago. The puddle in the northeast corner had spread, a thin film of water reaching toward the door. The drain hissed softly, failing to keep up.

He stood at the threshold. He was still wearing shoes. The rubber soles were thin, but they were there. He told himself that mattered.

He opened his laptop. Two bars. The signal in the bathroom was full, a strong, mocking invitation. He stepped inside, carefully, keeping his feet on the driest tiles near the door. He looked at the puddle like it was a dog that might bite.

He set his laptop on the closed toilet lid. He balanced it there, the hinge wobbling. He sat on the edge of the sink, the porcelain cold even in the heat. He opened his draft email. He attached the deck again. He hit send.

The progress bar moved. It moved faster than it had in the hallway. He felt a rush of relief that was almost euphoria. He could do this. He could solve this. He had been right about the signal.

Then the bar froze at sixty percent.

He waited. It moved to sixty-one. It stopped again. The wheel spun. The wheel stopped. The WiFi bars blinked.

He cursed and clicked send again. The laptop chimed. A low battery warning slid across the bottom of the screen. Fifteen percent.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. He ignored it and focused on the bar. He clicked. He waited. The bar moved two percent. The rain hit the roof harder. The light above him flickered, the fluorescent tube briefly dimming, then flaring back to life. The sound of the ballast buzzing grew louder, a mosquito in his ear.

The laptop dropped to fourteen percent.

He breathed through his nose, slow and controlled. There were still options. He could leave the bathroom and lose the signal. He could stay and try to finish. He could charge, just for a moment, just enough to push the email through. He could do it safely, he told himself, by not stepping in the puddle, by keeping the cord off the floor, by keeping one foot dry, by being careful. He was very good at being careful when he decided to be.

His phone buzzed again. He glanced at it. Jonah. He took the call, his hand slick with humidity.

"Marcus," Jonah said. He was out of breath, like he had been running. "You there?"

"Yeah," Marcus said. "I'm here. I'm trying to send the deck. The WiFi is..."

"You didn't send it earlier." Jonah sounded tired. Not angry. Tired was worse. "I have fifteen minutes before I go into another meeting. If I don't see the numbers, I can't help you."

Marcus leaned back against the sink and closed his eyes. The sink was damp, the porcelain slick. "I'm sending it now. I'm in a hostel in Bangkok. The power is unstable. Give me two minutes." He hated how small his voice sounded.

"Two minutes," Jonah said. "Marcus, listen. We can talk about the story later. I need the numbers. We need to be able to show something."

"I know." Marcus watched the bar inch forward. Sixty-three percent.

"If we don't get this," Jonah said, "I can't keep you in the bridge."

Marcus's mouth went dry. "I know." He said it again, because he didn't have a better word.

"Okay." Jonah exhaled. "Call me when it's sent."

He hung up.

Marcus stared at the screen. The progress bar hung at sixty-five percent. The low battery warning reappeared, polite and merciless. Thirteen percent.

He looked at the outlet. The wall plate had a thin crack at its edge, the same crack he'd seen before, now wider. The sign below it drooped, the letters bleeding. The charging adapter lay on the sink, wet and scuffed, the prongs darkened from the earlier surge. It looked like a small dead animal.

He picked it up. It was warm. He turned it over in his hand. The plastic was slightly warped where the surge had hit. It still fit. It still worked, he told himself. The surge had been a fluke. The water was a risk, but risk could be managed. He could stand on the dry tiles. He could keep the cord away from the puddle. He could do it fast.

He thought of Bee, her voice flat: Trash is better than dead.

He thought of his mother: I had a dream. You were standing in water.

He thought of Ruth: You can be smart or you can be alive.

He thought of Jonah: I need the numbers.

He watched the bar move to sixty-six percent. It stopped.

He sighed and did what he always did when confronted with a choice between humility and control. He chose control. He reached for the outlet.

---

The adapter went in with a soft, reluctant click. The outlet gave a tiny, almost imperceptible hum, like a throat clearing.

Marcus held his breath. He waited for the spark that had come earlier, the pop, the blue flash. Nothing. The light above him steadied. The phone didn't buzz. The air stayed the same. A small wave of relief washed through him, hot and shameful.

"See?" he muttered to himself. "Fine." He plugged the other end into his laptop. The charging icon appeared, a little lightning bolt that felt like a promise.

He shifted his feet. The tiles were cool, wet. He made sure his shoes were on the dry patch near the door. He kept his weight on his heels. He held the laptop in his hands instead of balancing it on the toilet, so he could pull it away quickly if he had to. He had a plan. He had a protocol. He was safe.

The progress bar jumped. Sixty-eight. Seventy. He felt an unreasonable rush of pride, the way he always did when something finally obeyed him. He clicked to open the deck and tried to send it again, hoping the system would resume the upload instead of starting over. It did neither. The email client froze.

He closed it and reopened it. The battery warning disappeared, replaced by the charging icon. He felt like a man catching his breath at the top of a stairwell.

The puddle made a small sound, a barely audible sizzle near the corner where the tile met the wall. He looked down. The water was creeping outward, thin and patient. The rain had found a crack in the window frame. It dripped steadily, each drop making a tiny ring in the water.

He shifted his feet again. The soles of his shoes were damp now. He told himself they were still insulating. He told himself a thin layer of rubber was enough. He told himself he knew enough about electricity to avoid the worst-case path. He told himself the current would take the ground, not him. He told himself a lot of things.

He clicked send. The bar moved faster now, the WiFi in the bathroom generous. Seventy-two. Seventy-four. He watched it like a stock ticker. He waited for it to stall again. It didn't. It went to eighty. Eighty-two. The hum in the outlet deepened slightly, or maybe it was his own blood in his ears.

The light above him flickered once. He looked up. The tube brightened, then settled. The buzz changed pitch, a mosquito becoming a wasp. The air smelled sharper, a clean, metallic scent that cut through the bleach. He recognized it, not from experience but from memory: the smell of ozone after a lightning storm. The smell of something ionizing.

He ignored it.

The progress bar hit ninety. His heart stuttered. He could almost taste the relief, the way he had when a push to production didn't crash. He opened the call app and prepared to dial Jonah. He clicked, the screen loading slowly. The lightning bolt icon in the corner still glowed.

A drop of water hit his hand. He looked up and saw a leak above the sink, a dark seam in the ceiling. The water ran along the edge of the pipe and fell, steady as a metronome. Each drop landed in the sink and echoed in the small room.

He was going to make it. He was going to push through. He was going to be the guy who solved it by being persistent. He was going to tell the story later as a joke: the time he closed a deal in a Thai hostel bathroom during a monsoon. It would sound good. It would sound like grit.

The progress bar hit ninety-five. It paused.

He felt his throat tighten. He tapped the trackpad. The cursor froze. The screen went white for a heartbeat, then came back. The WiFi bars flickered. The charging icon blinked.

He stood there, in a wet room with a live outlet and a laptop in his hands, waiting for the world to decide whether it wanted him alive or not. He didn't see the way his shoelace had dipped into the edge of the puddle. He didn't notice the way the water had crept closer to his left heel. He was watching the bar.

The bar moved to ninety-six. Ninety-seven.

The bathroom light dimmed. Somewhere in the wall, a wire complained. The hum in the outlet thickened, a lower vibration that seemed to rise through the tile and into his bones. The smell of ozone sharpened, metallic and clean, like a knife.

He whispered, "Come on," as if the laptop could hear him. He wasn't praying. He didn't believe in anything like that.

The upload hit ninety-eight.

The room flickered again, quick. He felt a tiny tingle in his fingertips, like the start of static. He told himself it was nothing. He had felt worse. He had already survived one zap tonight. He had learned. He had adapted. He was in control.

The bar hung at ninety-eight. He waited. The silence in the room thickened. Even the rain seemed to hold its breath. The water at his feet glimmered, a thin sheen reflecting the white of his laptop screen.

His phone buzzed again. Jonah. He didn't answer. He was too close. He could not break focus now. He watched the bar, willing it to move, to end, to get him out of the room and out of this decision.

The bar flicked to ninety-nine.

He smiled without meaning to. His chest loosened. He was about to succeed. He was about to be right.

Then the light above him blinked out for a heartbeat, and he heard, very softly, the pop.

---

He froze.

The pop was small, not like a breaker tripping or a fuse blowing. It was the sound of a rubber band snapping. It came from the outlet. The light returned. The laptop stayed on. The charging icon still glowed.

He could have stepped away right then. He could have unplugged. He could have walked out, dripping and annoyed but alive. He didn't. He watched the bar. He waited for the send confirmation. He needed it, he told himself. He needed it like a gambler needs one more hand.

The progress bar stayed at ninety-nine. The cursor spun. The spinning wheel was the only movement in the room. It spun and spun, a tiny white circle in a world of damp tile and buzzing light.

He flexed his fingers around the laptop, the edges pressing into his palms. The metal felt cooler than it should have, almost slick. The air smelled like hot plastic now. He realized he was sweating, not from heat but from focus, a cold sweat that made his shirt stick to his back.

He looked down. The puddle had crept to the toe of his right shoe. The rubber sole was wet, the water reflecting the light in thin, trembling lines. His left shoe was still on dry tile. He told himself that meant the circuit would not find him. He told himself that meant he could keep his feet where they were and the danger would be abstract, theoretical.

He thought about electricity as if it were a business model. Current was demand. Resistance was friction. If he could keep resistance high, he would not be part of the path. He had read that wet skin lowered resistance. He told himself his skin was dry. He told himself the shoes were insulating. He told himself the water did not care.

The cursor stopped spinning. The progress bar disappeared. The email client flashed. A message appeared: Sent.

He let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. His shoulders slumped. He was done. He was safe. He could unplug and leave. He could wash his hands and laugh at himself in the mirror. He could go back to bed and pretend he hadn't made a stupid choice.

He didn't move. He felt the adrenaline still in him, a buzzing in his veins. The laptop in his hands was still plugged in, still drawing power. The charger cable lay in a soft loop on the sink, one end in the outlet, the other in the laptop. The loop was damp where it touched the porcelain. He imagined the electricity flowing through it like water, like a river that didn't know or care what it passed through.

He should have unplugged. He did not. He opened the call app and dialed Jonah.

"You sent it?" Jonah asked as soon as he answered.

"Just now," Marcus said, looking at the sent message like it might vanish. "Did you get it?"

There was a pause. The line crackled. The WiFi bars on his laptop flickered.

"I see it," Jonah said. "Okay. Look. I'm going to be honest. The numbers are worse than we expected."

Marcus tightened his grip on the laptop. The metal edge dug into his palm.

"But," Jonah said, "if we can restructure, maybe..." He kept talking, words blurring into a soft wall. Marcus heard him, but he didn't. He was too tuned to the room, to the hum, to the light, to the way the wet tile felt under his shoes.

A drop of water hit the charging brick on the sink. It sizzled, a tiny hiss. Marcus's eyes snapped to it. The brick smoked for a second, a thin curl. He should have unplugged. He didn't. He told himself it was just a drop. He told himself it was fine.

"Marcus?" Jonah said. "Are you there?"

"Yeah," Marcus said. "I'm here." He moved his left foot to adjust his stance. The edge of the puddle brushed the side of his shoe. He felt the water through the thin fabric, a cold kiss.

He told himself he would unplug as soon as the call ended. He told himself he was almost done. He told himself he could hold on.

The light above him flickered. The buzz in the wall deepened. The air smelled sharper. He felt another faint tingle, this time up his wrist, as if someone had plucked a string inside him.

He swallowed. He kept talking to Jonah. He kept nodding, even though Jonah couldn't see him. He kept standing in a wet room with a live outlet and a dying courage.

When Jonah finally said, "I'll call you tomorrow," Marcus said, "Thanks," and ended the call. He stared at the laptop, still plugged in, still charging, still in his hands.

He should have unplugged. He didn't. He was tired. He was relieved. He was dumb.

He turned toward the outlet and reached for the plug.

His shoe slid an inch. The puddle caught it. The water crept under the sole.

He froze, hand hovering over the adapter, and in that suspended moment, with the room buzzing and the rain pounding and the laptop humming against his palms, he had the thought that would have saved him if he had listened to it:

This is a bad idea.

---

He ignored it.
