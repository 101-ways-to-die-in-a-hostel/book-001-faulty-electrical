# Chapter 22: Let-Go Threshold

He didn't unplug because the room told him he was safe.

The email was sent. The call was over. The lightning bolt icon still glowed in the corner like a tiny halo. He told himself: why waste the charge? The logic was impeccable in the way bad logic always is. He had done the thing. The crisis was over. The risk was now optional.

He stood in the wet bathroom with the laptop warm in his hands, the cord a vein to the wall, and he let the relief settle over him like a blanket. He could feel the water in his shoes now. The rubber had surrendered. The damp had found its way in. It was no longer the clean separation he'd promised himself.

He should have unplugged. He didn't. He watched the battery tick from thirteen to fourteen percent like a heartbeat recovering. He imagined it as runway, as minutes, as a spreadsheet he could actually control. For a few seconds he felt the rare, druglike sensation of competence.

Another drop hit the charging brick. It hissed. The sound was so small it barely existed, a whisper of heat. He saw the smoke curl up and vanish into the light. The smell of hot plastic joined the bleach and mildew, a three-note chord that was not supposed to be played together.

He flinched. He wanted to tell himself he had flinched because he was prudent. The truth was his body knew before his brain did. It had been keeping score all night. It had felt the earlier jolt in the common room, the tiny sting at his fingertips, the hum in the wall. It was tired of negotiating with his arrogance.

He reached for the adapter at last.

His fingers brushed the wet plastic. It was slick, like a bar of soap. The skin on his fingertips tingled as if he'd licked a nine-volt battery. The sensation was tiny but immediate, a private spark between him and the outlet. He jerked back. The laptop tugged with him, the cord taut, and the puddle sloshed under his shoes.

He froze, hand hovering, lungs locked. The tingling faded. The room kept buzzing. The lights stayed on. The laptop didn't die.

He laughed once, a sharp sound that was more a bark than humor. "Okay," he whispered. "Okay. Message received." He sounded like someone talking to a customer support bot.

He went to the sink and grabbed a dry corner of his towel. It wasn't dry, but it was less wet. He wrapped it around the adapter and yanked. The plug came loose with a reluctant pop, like a tooth.

The outlet hummed as the prongs slid free. The sound lowered and then stopped, leaving a silence so complete he could hear the rain upstairs and the drain's slow failing gulp. He set the adapter on the sink, still wrapped, and powered down the laptop. The room dimmed around him, not because the light changed, but because he had lost his small bright screen.

He stood there a moment longer, letting his pulse come back to a steady rate, letting his shoulders drop. His hand still tingled. He told himself it was adrenaline.

He left the bathroom.

The hallway felt cool by comparison, though it was just as humid. The air here smelled like detergent and old socks. He walked toward the stairs and looked down into the common room. The couches had turned into piled bodies. The lights were dimmed, only the front desk lamp casting a yellow pool on Bee's face.

Bee looked up as he passed. It was not a friendly look. It was a look like a warning sign still taped to a wall.

"You went," she said.

"I didn't charge in the bathroom," he lied. It came out automatically. It was a reflex as practiced as turning on a laptop.

Bee stared at him. The quiet between them was a space where she could have called him on it. She didn't. She was too tired for truth.

"You are wet," she said instead.

"Monsoon," he said, as if they were talking about weather. He didn't mention the outlet. He didn't mention the small electric bite in his fingertips. He held the laptop close to his chest like a shield.

Bee turned back to her phone. He kept going.

The dorm room on the second floor was a row of dark bunks and snoring strangers. He climbed into his top bunk, wiped the damp off his laptop with the edge of his shirt, and set it beside him. The mattress was damp too, the sheet rough and slightly sticky. He lay on his back and stared at the ceiling, at the underside of the bunk above, at the graffiti scratched into the slats. One said LUV = LIES in black marker. Another said FREE WIFI? LOL.

He closed his eyes. The email had been sent. Jonah had the deck. The immediate crisis was over.

His phone buzzed.

He opened the message from his sister without thinking. The screen light made a small blue cave around his face.

You okay? Mom says you're in Thailand. Be safe. The monsoon photos on the news look insane.

He typed back: All good. Living the adventure. You should visit.

He stared at his own text. It felt like a lie written by his publicist. He looked out through the mesh of the bunk, toward the small window at the end of the room. Rain was streaking down the glass. The neon outside made it look pink.

He thought about safety as a word that only existed on insurance forms. He thought about how safety was assumed in the world he came from, like clean water or fast WiFi. He thought about how his parents hadn't once asked if he was safe, not really. They had asked about his runway, his plans, his next iteration. Safety wasn't a metric. It didn't show on a chart.

The mattress shifted. The guy below him rolled over and muttered. Marcus heard the faint squeal of the hostel plumbing, the pipes expanding and contracting as if the building itself were trying to breathe. The hum of electricity in the walls seemed to follow him even here, a faint vibration that blended with the rain.

He could sleep. He should sleep. It was after one. His eyes burned. His body felt wrung out.

He picked up his laptop anyway.

The battery sat at sixteen percent. The email was sent. The deck was out. But now that he had done the hard part, his brain immediately invented the next problem to solve. The habit was a reflex. It didn't know how to stop.

He opened his notes app and made a list of follow-ups for Jonah: updated churn numbers, a revised pricing slide, a better narrative about the bridge. He was writing to avoid thinking. He was writing to avoid the idea that he might not have a company anymore.

When he finished, he looked at the list and felt the familiar dull panic. The list meant work. The list meant he would need power again. The list meant he would need WiFi.

He closed the laptop and set it aside. He told himself he was done for the night.

A muffled boom rolled through the building. The lights in the dorm flickered, dimming to a sepia glow. Someone down the hall shouted in his sleep. The air stilled for a beat. Then the lights returned, bright and cold.

He sat up. The power surge had felt like a wave. It had passed under his skin. He imagined it tracing the wiring behind the walls, old copper and newer tape and exposed joints. He imagined the bathroom outlet sparking in the dark, alone.

He should be glad the power came back. He should be grateful for the small stability. Instead he felt tense, as if the building had just cleared its throat and was about to say something worse.

He slipped on his shoes and climbed down from the bunk. He didn't wake anyone. He moved like a man trying not to wake his own conscience.

He went downstairs.

The common room was quiet. The bar fridge hummed again, a tired mechanical sigh. The couches were occupied by shapes under towels. The bucket under the leak was nearly full, water plinking into it in slow, rhythmic drops. Each drop sounded like a minute ticking in the dark.

Bee was still at the desk. Her phone glowed in her palm. She looked up as he approached.

"No more WiFi," she said, as if she had read his mind. "Router not working now. It does that. Maybe tomorrow. Mai pen rai." The phrase landed like a shrug, but there was a warning tucked inside it. Don't fight what you can't fix. Don't drown in it.

"I already sent what I needed," he said.

She didn't look convinced. She glanced at his laptop, at the cable dangling out of his bag like a tail. "You should sleep," she said. It wasn't advice. It was the closest thing to kindness she'd given him all night.

He nodded and walked past her toward the courtyard. He wasn't sure why. Maybe he wanted air. Maybe he wanted to prove he could still decide where his body went.

The courtyard was a narrow rectangle of wet concrete, open to the rain. The monsoon had eased to a constant drizzle. The cigarette butts in the ashtray floated like dead petals. A stray cat watched him from under a plastic chair, eyes reflecting the neon from the street.

He stood under the awning and breathed the air. It smelled of wet asphalt and fried oil. Somewhere beyond the wall, Khao San Road was still alive, a muffled thump of bass and laughter and scooters. The city didn't care about his email or his outlet or his fear. The city would keep spinning.

He scrolled through his phone. Jonah had sent a short message: Call tomorrow. We'll talk.

He typed back a thumbs-up emoji. It felt like surrender.

He wanted to post something. He wanted to reclaim the narrative. He opened X and started drafting: Closing a deck upload in a monsoon. Love these edge-case environments. Infrastructure is the next frontier.

He read it and winced. It sounded like a parody of himself. He deleted it.

He opened LinkedIn instead, because LinkedIn was where you told the safe, rehearsed version of danger. He wrote: Late-night hustle in Bangkok. No glam, just grit. Another reminder that resilience beats comfort. He attached a photo of his damp laptop against the neon-lit window and hit post.

The blue “posted” checkmark felt like a small, synthetic victory. He put the phone away.

The courtyard was empty. The rain tapped the awning. He could hear the buzz of a mosquito near his ear. He swatted and missed. The mosquito landed on his knuckle and drank. He let it. It was at least a transaction that involved real blood.

He went back inside.

On the stairs he nearly collided with the German guy from earlier, now in a dry shirt and carrying a plastic bag of noodles.

"Bathroom still flooding?" the guy asked, mouth full.

"Yeah," Marcus said.

"You do not charge there, right?" the guy said. He said it lightly, like a joke, but his eyes were serious.

"No," Marcus said. The lie tasted worse this time. "Just checking signal."

The guy nodded, unconvinced. "My cousin got shock in Laos once. He thought it was funny. It is not funny when your arm won't let go. The electricity, it is like a snake. It grabs." He slurped a noodle, paused, then added, "You are American? You have this thing, yeah? You think you can fix everything. Thailand is not iPhone." He smiled to soften it. "Sleep."

Marcus forced a laugh. "Good advice," he said.

He went up to his bunk and lay down. His heart was still beating too fast. The German's words about the arm not letting go made his own fingers twitch. He flexed them and felt a residual buzz in his palm, a ghost of the outlet. He told himself it was nothing. He told himself his body was just tired.

He closed his eyes. Sleep came in fragments.

He dreamed of wires. He dreamed of standing in a pool of light that turned into water. He dreamed of his mother calling his name from another room and him not being able to answer because his jaw was locked.

He woke to the sound of rain changing pitch. The roof was shedding a heavier sheet now, like a curtain of coins. The room was dark. His phone said 2:47 AM.

He lay still, trying to ignore the itch to check his email. He lasted maybe thirty seconds.

There was a new message from Jonah. It was only two words: Need update.

Marcus stared at it. The words were small, the demand large. It didn't matter that he had sent the deck. It didn't matter that the problem had been delivered. The work never ended. The runway never lengthened. The bridge was always moving.

He sat up. The dorm was quiet. The air was cooler now, the rain dragging some heat out of it. He looked at the laptop beside him. The battery had dipped to twelve percent during his sleep, a slow leak.

He could ignore it. He could reply in the morning. He could go back to sleep and let Jonah wait.

He pictured Jonah in a glass office, bright and dry, looking at his phone, deciding whether to keep caring. He pictured his mother in Palo Alto, asleep in a house with grounded outlets, not worrying because she had learned that worry didn't change him. He pictured his sister, a question mark in a dorm across town. He pictured his own feed, his followers, his brand, the thing he had built out of other people's attention.

He climbed down again.

The hallway was darker now. The lights were on a timer, dimmed between two and eight a.m. The flicker was more pronounced, the fluorescent tubes groaning as if they had been asked to do something beyond their pay grade.

He walked toward the stairs and paused. The ground-floor bathroom door was closed. The hallway was still. The smell of bleach was stronger here, a ghost of the mop bucket. The air felt colder by the door. The bathroom was a cold spot, a small pocket of humidity and electricity.

He told himself he would not go in. He could reply from the common room. He could use his phone. He could go to the courtyard and pretend he had a signal. He could do anything else.

He went in.

The bathroom light clicked on with a stutter. The puddle had grown. The water was deeper now, a thin mirror across half the floor. The leak in the ceiling had become a steady trickle that struck the sink and splashed out in a spray of droplets. The drain gurgled and failed. The hand-written sign still clung to the wall, its ink smeared into a gray smear that looked like a bruise.

He stood in the doorway and scanned the floor for dry spots. There were fewer. The tiles that had been safe were now slick. He shifted his weight, testing the grip of his shoes.

He stepped in anyway, staying close to the door. He set the laptop on the toilet lid again, like a ritual. He opened his email. He typed a short reply to Jonah: Need 10 minutes. Updating deck now.

He had no intention of updating the deck. He just needed time. He needed to look like he was doing something. The lie felt easier in a bathroom than it did in a boardroom.

He checked the WiFi. Two bars. It was enough. He hit send. It went.

He could have walked out. He didn't. He wanted more time. He wanted the laptop to stay on. He wanted the battery to stop bleeding.

He looked at the outlet.

The outlet looked worse. The crack in the plate was wider, the edges blackened. The wall around it was damp. The sign next to it sagged like wet paper. The cord from earlier lay in the sink, still damp. The adapter was on the edge of the sink, its plastic pitted from the earlier hiss.

He touched the adapter with the back of his finger. It was cool now. He told himself that meant it was safe. He told himself the earlier tingling had been a warning, a token payment, the universe's way of saying consider the risk. He told himself he had considered it. He told himself he could do it better this time.

He unfolded his towel on the floor to create a dry mat. It was a thin, blue towel with a frayed edge. It absorbed the top layer of water but not the damp underneath. He stepped onto it anyway and felt the wetness creep through the fibers.

He plugged the adapter into the outlet.

The light above him flickered. The hum returned. The laptop's charging icon reappeared. He felt a small thrill, not of relief but of control. He had found a workaround. He had built a safety layer. He had, in his mind, engineered a solution.

He opened the deck and stared at the slides. The numbers were bad. He changed a label. He shifted a graph. He moved a decimal in a way that made the trend line less alarming. He told himself he was reframing, not lying. He told himself he was buying time.

A drop hit the back of his neck. He wiped it away with the edge of his shirt, irritated. The leak had found a new path. The ceiling above him had a dark vein now, a line of moisture spreading like a crack in ice.

He kept working. He could feel the current in the room, a subtle vibration, like the air itself had teeth. The towel under his feet was soaked now. He felt the cool of the tile through it. His socks were damp inside his shoes. He shifted his weight to keep circulation, a minor discomfort that would have been negligible anywhere else and felt ominous here.

He sent the updated deck to Jonah. It went. He waited for the confirmation message. It arrived. He didn't unplug.

He opened a new email, this one to his mother. He started typing: Everything is fine. He erased it. He typed: It's rough but I'm okay. He erased that too. He typed nothing. He stared at the blank field, the cursor blinking like a pulse.

He thought about being ordinary. He thought about being a man in a wet bathroom at three in the morning, trying to optimize his way out of a corner. He thought about the fact that the only place in the hostel with decent WiFi was the same place with the worst outlet. The absurdity of it made him almost laugh.

He heard footsteps outside. The door opened a crack. A face peered in, half asleep, hair sticking up.

"Dude," a voice slurred. "You charging in there?"

Marcus froze. "No," he said, the lie automatic. "Just using the WiFi."

The guy squinted at the cord. The cord was visible, a bright white line from wall to laptop. Marcus saw it at the same time. He felt his stomach drop.

"Man," the guy said, shaking his head. "You don't want that. I got zapped earlier just touching the plate." He held up his hand to show a red mark on his palm, a faint line. "It's not good."

"I'm fine," Marcus said. "It's just for a few minutes."

"It's always just for a few minutes," the guy said, then closed the door, leaving the phrase hanging like a damp towel.

Marcus stared at the cord. He stared at the water on the floor. He stared at the thin towel. He saw the logic unraveling and held on anyway. The deck was sent. He could unplug now. He should have unplugged.

His phone buzzed again. Jonah. He was calling.

Marcus answered with a practiced cheer. "Hey."

"I got it," Jonah said. He sounded distracted, like he was walking. "We can use this, maybe. But the burn rate..." He sighed. "We need to cut. A lot."

Marcus looked at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, small and warped by water spots. "Cut how much?"

"Half," Jonah said. "At least."

Marcus laughed. It was a short, sharp sound, inappropriate to the moment. "There is no half. It's me and a contractor in Poland."

"Then it's you," Jonah said. "I'm sorry, man. The market is brutal."

Brutal. Marcus had used the word in pitches before. It felt different on his skin now. He gripped the laptop a little tighter, knuckles whitening.

"I can pivot," Marcus said. He could hear his own voice slipping into that pitch voice, the one that always sounded like hope and always meant panic. "We can do a B2B play. We can—"

"Marcus," Jonah said, softer. "You need to breathe."

He didn't. He held his breath, as if oxygen was a limited resource. The air in the bathroom felt thin. The hum in the outlet felt loud. The water under his feet felt colder, as if it had crept higher.

"I'll call you in a few days," Jonah said. "Take care of yourself." It was the closest thing to kindness Jonah had offered all year. Marcus didn't know how to answer it.

"Yeah," he said. "Thanks." He ended the call.

He stood there, holding a laptop like a life support machine, surrounded by water he had invited to the room. He was too tired to move. He was too angry to sit. He stared at the adapter. He could feel the heat in it now, a quiet pulse.

He thought about unplugging. He thought about leaving the laptop to die and sleeping in the dark. He thought about being ordinary, being safe, being invisible. He thought about his parents' kitchen with its grounded outlets and its perfect granite, his mother's voice saying, You can't outsmart everything.

He decided to ignore it.

He unplugged the adapter anyway.

The relief was immediate and ridiculous, like taking off a tight shoe. He set the laptop on the toilet lid and rubbed his hands on his shorts. His fingers were shaking. He told himself it was caffeine. He hadn't had caffeine in hours.

He stepped off the towel. The tile was slick. His foot skated a half inch. He caught himself on the sink. His palm slapped the porcelain and slid. His wrist touched the damp rim. A tiny sting ran up his arm. It was enough to make him swear.

He stood still, breathing hard. The light flickered again. He stared at his hand. The skin was normal. He didn't see a burn. He felt a faint prickling. He told himself it was nothing. He told himself he was imagining it.

He gathered his things. He reached for the towel. The towel was soaked and heavy. He left it on the floor, a wet flag of surrender. He tucked the laptop under his arm and moved toward the door.

He hesitated at the threshold. The bathroom was still humming, a faint vibration in the air. The puddle glimmered. The outlet stared back at him with its blackened eyes. The sign drooped, the words NO CHARGING turned to a gray smear that could have said anything.

He turned the light off and left.

The hallway felt like a different country. The air was cooler. The hum of the bathroom receded into a memory. He stood outside his dorm room and listened. The sounds were soft: breathing, the faint squeak of a bunk, the rain on the roof.

He didn't go in. He leaned against the wall and slid down to sit on the floor. The tile was cold. He set the laptop on his knees and stared at the screen without turning it on.

He thought about what he would tell Jonah tomorrow. He thought about what he would tell his mother if she called. He thought about the post he had made on LinkedIn, the way it would read in the morning. He thought about the thin gap between the life he was performing and the life he was actually living.

A light flickered at the end of the hall. The bulb buzzed, then steadied. The building was tired. It was always tired. It was a machine that had been asked to do too much for too long.

He opened his laptop. The battery was at eleven percent. The WiFi bar in the corner flashed, searching. It connected for a second, then dropped. He closed it again.

His phone buzzed. A new email, not from Jonah. From an unfamiliar address. Subject line: "We saw your deck."

His heart jumped. The message was short and cryptic. It praised his vision. It asked for a follow-up. It was signed by someone he didn't know. It was probably a scam. It might not have been. In his world, the difference was often a matter of belief.

He stared at the email. The battery in his phone was at twenty percent. The laptop was at eleven. The WiFi signal was faint in the hallway and non-existent in the dorm. The bathroom, he knew, had signal.

He told himself no. He told himself he would reply in the morning. He told himself that scams could wait. He told himself that he was done with water and outlets and bad choices.

He stood up.

He went back toward the bathroom.

He stopped outside the door, his hand on the handle. He could hear the faint buzz from the light inside, the humid breath of the room. He could smell the bleach and the ozone and the damp. He could feel the slickness of the tile under his shoes.

He opened the door.

The puddle had spread to the threshold. The water was darker now, carrying tiny bits of grit and soap. The leak in the ceiling was steady, a thin stream. The drain gurgled. The sign had fallen to the floor, half-submerged.

He stepped inside.

The towel he had left was still there, a soaked blue island. He stepped on it and felt the cold seep through. He set his laptop on the toilet lid. He lifted the adapter. He told himself: ten minutes. A single reply. Then sleep. Then safety.

He reached for the outlet.

The light flickered.

The hum deepened.

He did not hear the building breathe. He did not hear the water remember. He did not hear the world making its final, patient argument.

He only heard his own voice, whispering to himself in the dark, as if that could make it true:

"Just this once."
