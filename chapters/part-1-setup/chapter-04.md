# Chapter 04: Eleven Thirty

The battery climbed by single digits like a reluctant elevator, and Marcus watched it with the kind of devotion people usually reserve for vital signs. He told himself that was progress, which was a dangerous definition.

---

The bathroom light buzzed in a way that made his teeth itch. The puddle had spread to the corners now, a thin skin of water that made the tile shine and the room feel even smaller. When he shifted his weight, the water slid around his toes with a slow, cold patience. The sink was damp from the last dozen people who had used it to wash off a night, to rinse off a hangover, to spit out a story. His laptop balanced on it anyway, one corner hanging over the edge like a dare.

He sat on the closed toilet lid and watched the clock on his screen: 10:58 PM. The battery said 11%. The charger light glowed green, a tiny dot of certainty in a room full of humid doubt. The WiFi bars hovered at two, a miracle for this building, a liar for anyone who trusted it.

He opened the deck and flipped through it like a priest rehearsing his sermon. Slide one, the vision: NomadSync. Slide two, the market: billions of remote workers, a graph pointing upward like a promise. Slide three, the traction: a line that should have been a curve but was a flat sigh. He practiced words under his breath. He said synergy. He said platform. He said pivot but pronounced it like expansion.

His phone buzzed. The screen lit with a calendar alert: CALL MATT 11:30 PM. His stomach clenched as if he had been punched. He checked the battery on his phone. Six percent. He plugged it into the laptop to top off. The laptop beeped in complaint, a quiet, wounded sound. He ignored it. He needed the phone to connect to the call, the laptop to screen share, the WiFi to hold long enough for him to pretend this was all going according to plan.

The light flickered. The sound in the hallway dimmed. He could hear a laugh outside the door, a burst of music, a shout. The hostel was starting its nightly surge, the moment the common room turned into a cheap promise and the rooftop turned into a wet dream. The rain, meanwhile, had chosen violence. It hammered the awning with the insistence of a creditor. The drain in the bathroom gurgled like it was swallowing its own regret.

He glanced at the sign on the wall. NO CHARGING. The letters were smudged now, softened by moisture. It looked less like a rule and more like a plea. He had never been good at pleas. He was a founder, which meant he was professionally allergic to being told no.

The adapter in the outlet emitted a thin, steady hum. He had started to take comfort in it. Electricity was like a heartbeat; you only noticed it when it stopped. He told himself he was not in danger. He told himself he was in control. He told himself that if anything went wrong, he would simply step back. He did not consider that his body might not agree.

He took a sip from his water bottle, which tasted faintly of plastic and the disinfectant used to clean the bathroom. He wiped his forehead. The humidity was a hand on his neck. He reopened the email thread from Matt and typed a draft message: "Looking forward to this, ready to walk through the numbers." He hovered over send, then erased it. Too eager. He rewrote: "Here now. Can jump on early if it helps." Better. He left it unsent. He needed the call to happen on schedule. He needed structure.

The battery ticked to 12%. He felt a small rush of victory. It was ridiculous, the way he could feel dopamine from a tiny percentage on a tiny screen. This was what his life had become: victory in inches, progress in pixels.

He stepped out of the bathroom to clear his head and was hit by the common room's wall of sound. The music had shifted into a slower, heavier beat, the kind that tried to feel meaningful while still being a party. Plastic cups were everywhere, a small sea of condensation on the coffee table. A British girl was teaching a Danish guy how to say "cheers" in Thai and getting it wrong on purpose. The ring-light girl had abandoned her tripod and was now dancing with someone twice her height, both of them filmed by a friend who would, tomorrow, narrate the night into a reel about "chaos as self-discovery."

Marcus moved through the bodies like a man with a backpack at a concert, trying not to spill his own urgency. He leaned on the bar of the honor-system fridge and checked the WiFi on his phone. One bar. It dropped. He lifted his phone higher, which was useless and still something he did, because it made him feel like he was doing a thing.

"You on a call later?" The sunburned guy with the nose ring leaned in close enough that Marcus could smell beer and coconut sunscreen. He nodded at the laptop under Marcus's arm. "Good luck in there, man. The connection is like a ghost."

"It's fine," Marcus said. "I have a setup."

"Bathroom?" the guy asked, like it was a joke. "That outlet in there is haunted."

"It's not haunted," Marcus said, and immediately regretted defending an outlet. "It's just loose wiring."

The guy laughed. "Sure. Loose wiring. Like my bank account." He stumbled back into the crowd, offering a sloppy thumbs-up as if he had solved a problem.

Marcus checked the clock. 11:07. He had time. He should stay by the bathroom. He should not get pulled into the current of other people's nights. He walked toward the reception desk instead, because part of him still believed in the magic of asking the right person for help.

Bee was behind the bars, thumb scrolling. The light above her flickered and made her look as tired as the building. He leaned in. "Any chance I can borrow a power bank? Or rent one?"

She looked up, then down, then back up. "We have none. People take."

"Right." He nodded, because the answer was exactly what he expected and he still needed to hear it. "Is there any other place I can charge? Just for a few minutes."

Bee's eyes slid toward the bathroom door and then back to him. "Not bathroom," she said, in the tone of someone tired of saying it. "It's dangerous. The floor is wet, the wiring is old. I told you."

"I'm just using the WiFi," he lied. His voice carried the polished sincerity of a founder talking about safety features. "No charging."

She held his gaze, then shrugged. It was not permission. It was surrender. "Mai pen rai," she said, not kindly. "Up to you."

He left her there, a woman in a sweatshirt that said ACCOUNTING IS MY SUPERPOWER, guarding an honor-system fridge and a failing router, and felt a twinge of something he didn't know how to name. It wasn't guilt. It wasn't respect. It was the uneasy recognition that she had been right about several things tonight and he had not listened to any of them.

He turned toward the hallway and nearly collided with Somchai, the older cleaner, who was pushing a mop bucket with the quiet determination of someone trying to finish a shift before the building did something else. The bucket sloshed. The water was cloudy. Somchai nodded at Marcus without stopping, his eyes tired but alert. He smelled of floor cleaner and rain. The mop head left a wet, shiny trail across the tile like a warning stripe.

"Bathroom closed?" Marcus asked, because he didn't know what else to say.

Somchai made a small gesture with his hand, a wave that meant yes and no at the same time. "Many people," he said. "Dirty. Wet." He frowned at the puddle outside the door and pushed the mop into it with a slow, resigned scrub.

Marcus stepped around him and hovered by the bathroom entrance. The NO CHARGING sign looked smug again, the taped corners peeling a little more. He could see the puddle creeping out from under the door. He could hear the hum from inside, the buzz of the light, the low electrical whine that had become a background note to his day. He should have taken the hint. He stepped in anyway, because the call was his only line now and lines were meant to be held.

Inside, the sink was exactly as he had left it. The laptop sat at a slight angle, the charger cable draped down. He set it back in place and checked the battery. Thirteen percent. He waited for it to tick to fourteen, as if the number would change the outcome of the call. His phone vibrated once, a low battery warning. He plugged it in again and felt the laptop protest with another small beep.

He looked at his reflection in the mirror, a blurred shape behind a film of moisture. The blue-light glasses made him look like a man playing a scientist. The buzz cut made him look like a man who had a reason for the cut, not a fear of thinning. He nodded at himself as if to say, You are fine. You are still a person worth betting on.

A soft crackle came from inside the wall. It was quick, like a piece of dry wood snapping. He paused, eyes on the outlet. The charger light remained green. The laptop did not turn off. He told himself it was nothing. He told himself the building was old and old buildings made sounds, like old people. He did not move.

---

At 11:24, the WiFi dropped to one bar and he felt a tidal panic rise in his chest.

He stood, lifted the laptop off the sink, and waved it around like a divining rod, looking for a stronger signal. The phone tethered to it lagged, the screen dimming as if it were tired of the entire process. He stepped closer to the door. The signal improved, then fell. He stepped back. It steadied at two. He put the laptop down again.

He counted the minutes. He checked the battery. Fourteen percent. He was going to make it. He told himself this as a fact rather than a hope, because hope was too fragile to build on.

At 11:30, the call came through. The phone lit with the incoming number. He inhaled, pressed accept, and forced his voice into the confident register he had practiced in mirror reflections and airport lounges.

"Hey, Matt," he said. "Appreciate you making time."

"Marcus." Matt's voice was crisp, clipped. There was no background noise on his end, just the faint hum of an air-conditioned office somewhere far from monsoon season. "Let's jump in. You said you had updated numbers."

Marcus flipped open the deck and began to speak, his eyes moving from bullet to bullet like a man reading a script he had written for himself. He talked about user growth. He talked about churn. He talked about a pivot that was actually a collapse. He said the word resilience twice. He hoped it sounded like strategy instead of desperation.

"Walk me through revenue," Matt said. There was a polite smile in his voice that did not reach his patience.

Marcus swallowed. The water at his feet was cold. The charger cable ran across the sink like a thin line of accusation.

"Revenue is down quarter over quarter because we deprioritized short-term monetization to focus on the product-led loop," he said. "We saw retention upticks in our top cohorts, and we expect a return to baseline once the model stabilizes."

He could hear himself. It sounded like a person selling a tent to someone who already owned a house. He kept going. "Our primary KPI is engagement in the community layer. That metric is up 12% month over month."

"And cash on hand?" Matt asked.

Marcus looked at the battery indicator. Fifteen percent. He decided to answer a different question.

"We have a couple strategic conversations happening," he said. "I'm in Bangkok right now because the market signal here is strong. Remote work adoption is accelerating in Southeast Asia. The infrastructure is weak, which is an opportunity."

"Marcus." There was a pause on the line. It was the kind of pause that usually preceded a gentle rejection. "I asked about cash on hand."

He felt a bead of sweat run down his back. The bathroom light flickered. The WiFi bars dipped, then returned. He gripped the phone tighter.

"About five weeks of runway," he said. It came out flatter than he wanted.

"You said eight last time."

"We had unplanned expenses." He could hear his own lie swelling in the humid air. The truth was that the expenses had been planned, the revenue had not, and the runway was more like two weeks if he paid the interest on Friday. The truth was that he was standing in a hostel bathroom trying to sound like a CEO.

Matt sighed. "Marcus, I like you. You know that. But the market is not rewarding growth at all costs anymore. I need to see evidence of revenue or a path to it. What you sent me doesn't show that."

The words landed like a wet slap. Marcus felt the familiar heat behind his eyes. He stared at the tiles, at the thin film of water, at the reflection of the overhead light. He nodded even though Matt couldn't see it.

"We can adjust the model," he said. "We've been building the infrastructure for monetization. We can turn the dial."

"How quickly?"

He opened his mouth, then closed it. He didn't know. That was the answer. He filled the space instead. "Two quarters."

"That's too long." Matt's voice was apologetic now, almost soft. "Look, I have to be responsible to my LPs. I can't lead another round without stronger fundamentals. If you can show revenue in the next month, let's talk again. But I can't commit to anything tonight."

A laugh almost escaped him. The idea of revenue in a month was absurd, a magic trick. He had been trying to pull it off for a year.

"Okay," he said. He tried to make it sound like a negotiation, not a collapse. "I understand. I'll send an updated plan in a week."

"Send it," Matt said. "And Marcus, take care of yourself."

The call ended. The screen went dark. Marcus stared at it. The battery on his phone dropped to three percent. The laptop was at sixteen. The WiFi held. The world, in that moment, felt like a set of numbers that had finally stopped adding up.

He sat on the toilet lid and breathed. The air smelled of bleach and wet tile and the faint ozone that had been there all night, more noticeable now that he wasn't speaking. His chest hurt in a way that felt almost physical, a bruise that had been waiting for a reason to appear.

He wanted to call his mother. He wanted to throw the laptop into the sink. He wanted to leave the hostel and never come back. He stayed, because staying was easier than moving.

He opened his notes app and typed: ACTION ITEMS. Under it, he wrote: 1) Monetization plan. 2) Cut burn. 3) Call mom. He stared at the last one. He didn't cross it out. He didn't act on it. He closed the app.

The battery on his laptop ticked up to seventeen. He felt nothing.

---

At 11:47, the power died for half a second and returned with a shudder.

The bathroom light blinked. The charger light flickered. The fan in the hallway coughed. Marcus flinched, then laughed at himself. He was not a child afraid of the dark. He was a founder afraid of irrelevance. There was a difference.

He reopened the email thread and drafted a follow-up to Matt. The words came out stiff, overly formal: "Appreciate your time tonight. I'll send updated revenue plan within a week. Thanks for the candid feedback." He stared at it, then added, "Bangkok is wild. Signal here is weak but the market is strong." He hit send.

The message stalled. The spinner appeared. He watched it. The WiFi bars wavered between one and two. The spinner kept going. He waited. It finally sent. He felt a tiny, hollow victory.

He unplugged his phone and checked it. Two percent. The screen dimmed as if exhausted. He put it in his pocket. The laptop was at nineteen percent now, enough to get him through a night, a call, a denial, a handful of emails. It was not enough to get him through his life. He did not think about that. He didn't have the bandwidth.

The water on the floor felt colder. He shifted his feet onto a drier patch and realized there wasn't one. The puddle had crept outward in slow increments while he was on the call, as if it had been listening and decided to move closer. The water covered the tile between the sink and the door. It lapped against the base of the toilet. It gathered around the drain but did not go in. The drain was choked, the building refusing to swallow what it produced.

He looked down at his feet. The skin at his arches had gone pale, wrinkled slightly. He could feel the constant low chill that came from standing in wet tile too long. He didn't move. The charger cable ran across the sink and down to the outlet, a white line against the mold-streaked wall. The outlet plate was cracked, a thin line of dark behind it. He could see the corroded wiring through the gap. He should have been bothered. He wasn't. He was tired.

A faint blue flash sparked behind the outlet plate. It was small, barely more than a blink. He saw it anyway. He smelled something sharp, the scent of melting plastic or maybe just hot dust. He lifted his hand to the outlet, stopped inches away. His fingertips tingled. He pulled back and told himself it was static.

He set the laptop on the sink and closed the lid. The battery light on the side glowed. He didn't unplug it yet. The idea of being without power made him feel naked. He leaned against the wall and let his head rest on the cool tile.

He thought about Matt's last sentence: take care of yourself. It sounded like a mother's instruction, not an investor's. He thought about his mother. He saw her in his mind, her jaw tight when she was trying not to worry, the way she used to pack extra snacks for him when he went to hackathons. He imagined calling her now and saying, I failed, and she would say, That's fine, come home, and it would not be fine. It would be a different kind of failure. He chose to sit in the bathroom instead.

The hallway music rose, then fell. The hostel outside ebbed and flowed like a tide, bodies moving, lights flickering, the building breathing in its own damp. He felt far away from all of it, alone in a six-by-six box with a laptop and a puddle.

He checked the time. 12:03 AM. The call was done, the night spent, the future still a question. He should have gone upstairs. He should have unplugged the charger. He should have listened to the sign. He didn't. He wanted the battery to reach twenty, a round number, a clean line. He wanted something to feel complete.

The power flickered again, stronger this time. The light dimmed, then surged bright. The outlet crackled. The charger light flickered. His body tensed without permission.

He reached for the charger, then stopped. A thin, almost inaudible buzz rose from the outlet, higher than before, like a mosquito circling a light. He held his breath. The sound grew, then steadied. The charger light returned to green. He let out the breath and told himself he was being dramatic. He told himself this place was full of drama and he was just picking it up like humidity.

He stepped back from the sink to give himself space, and his right foot slid deeper into the puddle. The water was warm now, or maybe his skin had numbed. It didn't matter. He felt a faint, almost pleasant tingle in his heel, the kind of sensation you get when your foot falls asleep. He shifted his weight, testing it. The tingle faded. He smiled, a small private smile, because he was already writing the rationalization in his head: static, humidity, nothing more.

He waited for the battery to tick to twenty. Nineteen. Nineteen. Nineteen. The number stalled, as if it were considering whether to grant him the satisfaction. The charger cable felt warm under his hand. The outlet hummed. The light buzzed. The rain hammered the awning.

Somewhere below, someone laughed hard enough to cough. Somewhere above, a bed squeaked. Somewhere in the wall, a wire sizzled for a second, a tiny whisper that felt like a warning. Marcus didn't move. He watched the number and told himself that if he waited just a little longer, he could finish the night on a neat, even percentage.

The battery clicked to twenty.

He reached for the charger.

The light flickered.

The outlet crackled.

The puddle touched both his feet.

And for the first time, he wondered if the hostel was humming back.

---

He left the bathroom five minutes later, the charger coiled in his hand, the laptop warm under his arm, the water still clinging to his skin.

The hallway felt colder than the bathroom, the air drier in a way that made the moisture on his legs feel heavy. He walked toward the stairs and stopped. The STAFF ONLY door was ajar, a sliver of darkness visible beyond. A low hum seeped out, the sound of machinery and old electricity, a steady breath that did not match the building's rhythm. He stared at it for a second, felt a prickle in the back of his neck, and kept walking.

Upstairs, the dorm was quieter. The party crowd had thinned. The fan spun, the light flickered, the room smelled like wet clothes and defeat. He set the laptop on his bunk and checked the email again. No reply. He refreshed once, twice, three times. Nothing. He closed it and faced the ceiling.

His phone was dead. The dark screen felt like a blank face. He placed it on the pillow beside him. The laptop hummed as it cooled. The hostel's electrical buzz pressed against the walls like a headache.

He closed his eyes and tried to sleep. The call replayed in his head, each line a small cut. He remembered Matt's pause, his careful non-commitment. He remembered Alan's voice. He remembered the puddle. He remembered the faint flash in the outlet. He told himself that tomorrow he would get a power bank, that tomorrow he would find a co-working space, that tomorrow he would be different.

The fan clicked once overhead. The light flickered again. The rain outside slowed to a steady hiss, like an animal finally tiring.

Marcus lay still and listened to the building breathe. In the darkness behind his eyelids, he saw the outlet sparking like a star he could not touch. He saw the puddle creeping across the tile, slow and patient. He saw the number on his battery, twenty, as if it meant something. He told himself he was safe now, that he was back in his bunk, that the worst of the night was over.

Below, in the ground-floor bathroom, the outlet hummed on, alone in the dark, waiting for the next time someone needed a signal.
