# Chapter 07: Wet Signal

The smell that woke him was not coffee or mildew but something thin and metallic, like a penny held between teeth, and Marcus lay there a moment pretending it was normal to wake with electricity in his nose.

---

He rolled onto his side and checked his phone out of habit, a ritual performed on a device that had gone dark in the night. The screen showed nothing. He pressed the power button twice, and it flickered to life with one percent as if to remind him that it could still die in his hands. The battery icon was a bruise.

The dorm was already up. The compass-tattoo guy was pulling on a shirt, a British girl on the lower bunk was swearing softly as she tried to untangle her hair. The fan clicked overhead, unsure of its own will. The air tasted like stale beer and rain-soaked fabric. Marcus lay back, let the weight of his laptop press into his ribs like a cheap anchor, and listened to the hostel hum.

He should call his mother. The idea had been sitting in his throat like a pill all week. He said her name in his head and felt his chest tighten in a way he didn't allow himself to call fear. He opened his contacts, hovered over her number, and watched the battery tick down from one percent to zero before he could make a choice. The screen went black. It felt like being hung up on.

He sat up and pulled the charger out. The adapter looked the same as it had yesterday, which was to say slightly singed at the edges, a faint brown ghost of heat on the plastic. He held it close and smelled it again: burnt dust, hot metal. He told himself it was normal, the kind of residue that came from any device that had been used too hard. He told himself his sense of smell was overreacting because he was overtired and everything in this building smelled like damp regret.

He went downstairs, laptop under his arm, charger in hand. The stairs creaked a complaint at every step. The hallway light flickered as he passed, as if the building was trying to blink something at him in Morse. He ignored it.

In the common room, people were already hunched over their phones like supplicants. The router blinked its lonely green light. The TV played a cooking show on mute. The toaster sparked when someone pushed the lever down and Marcus flinched so hard he felt it in his teeth. The man who had done it laughed and said, “Electricity in this place is wild.”

Marcus smiled because a smile was easier than admitting he had been scared by a toaster.

Bee was behind the desk with her coffee. She looked up when he approached and lifted her eyebrows in a tired way that said she already knew he was about to ask her something she couldn't fix.

“Morning,” he said.

“Morning,” she said.

“Is the WiFi any better?”

She made a sound that was half a laugh, half a sigh. “Same. Rain.”

“It’s not raining,” he said, and immediately regretted it because it sounded petty.

Bee pointed toward the open doorway where the courtyard shimmered with wet tile. “Always rain,” she said. It was both a joke and a truth.

He almost told her about the power bank dying, about the call with Matt, about the way the outlet had flashed blue last night. He didn't. He asked the only question he allowed himself. “Can I borrow a charger? A real one?”

Bee shook her head. “We don't have. People take.” She sipped her coffee. “You can buy on street.”

He nodded, thanked her, and walked outside into the wet heat.

The morning in Khao San was a damp, heaving thing. Vendors shouted, scooters skidded through puddles, a monk moved through the crowd with his bowl, calm in a way that made everyone else look like they were improvising. Marcus stepped around a cart selling mango sticky rice and tried not to think about the fact that his entire company was less stable than a fruit seller's cash box.

He saw the tangle of overhead wires as he crossed the street, black vines sagging under the weight of rain. Water dripped from them in slow, deliberate drops, a tiny threat. A spark snapped at a junction and died. The tuk-tuk driver next to him didn't flinch. Marcus did, then pretended he hadn't.

He found a stall with adapters and cables hanging like candy. The vendor, a woman in a pink apron, held up a white brick that claimed to be “FAST CHARGE 65W.” The letters were crooked. The plastic felt too light. Marcus asked the price. She said six hundred baht. He said four. They settled at five without the ceremony of haggling, both of them tired of pretending this was about anything but survival.

He bought it anyway. He told himself it was better to have a cheap solution than no solution. He told himself, because he had to, that cheap was not always dangerous. He said it in his head like a mantra and walked back toward the hostel with the bag swinging at his side like a small, plastic promise.

At the entrance, Somchai was mopping the same patch of tile he'd been mopping for days. The mop pushed water into a corner; the water pushed back. He didn't look up when Marcus passed. He was too busy wrestling a puddle that refused to be tamed.

Marcus headed upstairs and plugged the new charger into the outlet by his bunk. The adapter slid in too easily, which felt wrong. The light on the brick blinked once, then steadied. He exhaled. The laptop battery climbed from forty to forty-one, slow and reluctant. He should have felt relief. He felt like he had just made another bet.

He opened his inbox. Nothing. He refreshed. Nothing. He opened LinkedIn and saw a post from someone he barely knew about “embracing failure as a catalyst.” He closed it with a thumb swipe of disgust. He opened his notes app and wrote, Call Mom. He stared at the words until they looked like a typo.

The power flickered. The charger light blinked and returned. He pulled the adapter out and felt it. Warm. Not hot. He put it back in. He told himself that was prudence. He told himself warmth was a sign of life.

---

By afternoon, the sky had gone the color of aluminum. The air pressed down with humidity, a heavy hand on the back of his neck. He sat in the common room with his laptop, trying to ride the one bar of WiFi like a surfer with a board too small for the wave. It held for ten seconds, dropped for twenty, held for five, dropped again. It was a cruel rhythm.

A group of Australians had dragged a table over and were playing a drinking game. Every time someone lost, they chanted “Chug!” like a promise. A French couple argued in low tones over a map. The ring-light girl had returned and was recording a video about “staying productive in chaos.” Marcus watched her for a moment and felt the impulse to correct her lighting, to tell her that chaos wasn’t a brand, it was a constraint. He did nothing.

His phone buzzed once. He checked it and saw a text from Lina: Did you call Mom? He looked at the message until it dimmed and his screen went dark again.

He could have walked to the co-working space. He could have paid for a real connection. He didn't. He had spent money on a new charger and told himself that was the day’s investment. His bank balance did not agree with him.

He stood and went to the reception desk, because he was running out of options and asking the tired receptionist was cheaper than owning his own decisions.

“Is there a better spot for WiFi now?” he asked.

Bee looked up. “Bathroom,” she said, and then, when he opened his mouth, added, “No charge. Floor wet.”

“Right,” he said. “Just the WiFi.”

She nodded once, but it wasn’t permission. It was the kind of nod you give someone who insists on learning from pain.

He waited until she looked away and then walked toward the hallway anyway, not because he wanted to defy her but because the options had thinned to a line he had already crossed.

The bathroom door was closed. The NO CHARGING sign hung crooked, its tape edges curled in the humidity. Someone had traced a little lightning bolt in pen under the word NO, a joke that made the warning feel smaller and the danger feel larger. He pushed the door open.

The room was warmer than the hallway, a moist pocket of air that smelled of bleach, mildew, and a metallic tang that made his tongue itch. The floor was wet as always, a thin sheet of water that gleamed under the buzzing fluorescent light. The puddle had spread to the door, a slick mirror that reflected his legs and the warped ceiling above.

He stepped in and felt the cool water wrap around his feet. He set the laptop on the sink, carefully balancing it so the corner didn't slip. He didn't plug anything in. He told himself that was restraint. He opened the laptop and watched the WiFi bars jump to two. It felt like being handed a glass of water after a day in the sun.

He opened a new email to his mother. He typed, Hi Mom. His fingers hovered, then deleted it. He typed, Just wanted to say hi. He deleted it. He typed, I’m okay. He deleted it. He stared at the blank screen and realized he had no version of the truth that would fit in a sentence.

He closed the laptop and opened his phone to call her instead. The phone was at two percent. The call would probably drop. The thought of the call dropping felt worse than not calling at all, so he didn’t. He put the phone back in his pocket and told himself he would do it later, from a place with a stronger signal, a stronger self.

The light flickered once. The hum in the walls rose and fell. He watched the puddle ripple as if something had moved beneath it. He blinked and realized it was just the rain on the roof vibrating the pipes. He told himself everything here was normal.

He left the bathroom without charging anything. He told himself that counted as progress.

---

He went upstairs and tried the new charger in the outlet by his bunk again, as if the extra attempt might redeem the purchase. The adapter buzzed softly when he plugged it in. The light on the brick glowed, then flickered twice and held. The laptop battery ticked up one percent and then refused to move. He stared at the number until it felt like watching a stock price in slow motion, all the drama with none of the control.\n\nThe compass-tattoo guy leaned over from the lower bunk. “You still fighting the power?” he asked.\n\n“I’m optimizing,” Marcus said.\n\nThe guy laughed. “Dude, I had a phone charger here last night. It got so hot it smelled like fries.” He shook his head. “I just go downstairs and take my chances. Bathroom’s got the best bars. Also the best chance to die in a puddle.”\n\nMarcus smiled thinly. “Noted.”\n\nHe unplugged the charger and shoved it back into his bag. The smell of warm plastic lingered. He told himself he was being cautious. He told himself he was simply choosing the environment with the highest probability of success. He told himself he had not been reduced to the same desperate calculus as everyone else in this building.\n\nHe climbed to the rooftop because he needed air, a signal, some evidence that the sky might give him a different answer than the walls. The stairwell smelled of damp concrete and old wood. The roof was slick, the plastic chairs upside down, the fairy lights sagging with rain. The city was a smear of neon in the wet darkness, temple spires glowing behind a curtain of drizzle, tuk-tuk headlights streaking like impatient fireflies. The tangle of overhead wires across the street looked like a black vein against the storm.\n\nHis phone showed one bar. He held it up anyway, a small human antenna in a city full of towers. Two bars flickered, then died. He walked to the edge and held it above the sagging railing, felt the rain cool his knuckles, watched the bar flicker again. He hit call on his mother’s number before he could talk himself out of it.\n\nIt rang once. Twice. It went to voicemail with a cheerful beep that felt like a door closing in his face.\n\nHe should have left a message. He opened his mouth and found it full of static. “Hey, Mom,” he said, and his voice sounded too small in the open air. “Just calling to say hi. I’m… I’m good. I’ll call later.” He hung up before he could make the lie larger. He watched the phone screen go dark, then put it back in his pocket as if it had burned him.\n\nA girl with a shaved sidecut and a plastic poncho stepped out onto the roof, dragging a damp cigarette. She nodded at him. “WiFi up here is trash,” she said, as if offering a travel tip. “But at least the rain’s clean.”\n\n“It doesn’t look clean,” Marcus said, and immediately hated himself for his own tone.\n\nShe laughed anyway. “You American?”\n\n“San Francisco.”\n\nShe exhaled smoke. “Ah. You guys think everything can be fixed with a new app.”\n\n“It can,” he said, reflexively, and then the humor hit him a second late. He let it pass. “What’s your name?”\n\n“Ruth,” she said. “England. Came for temples, got dengue instead. Bangkok’s the gift that keeps on giving.” She glanced down at the street where a light flickered in a shop window. “Heard a guy got shocked here last year. Not bad, like a zap. But he was barefoot in the shower and it bit him.” She flicked her cigarette toward a puddle. “Don’t let it bite you.”\n\nMarcus forced a laugh. “Not planning on it.”\n\n“Everybody plans,” she said. She wandered to a chair, sat on its upturned legs like a throne, and stared out at the rain.\n\nMarcus stood for another minute, watching the wires sway, listening to the rain hit the metal roof like a drumline of bad timing. A small blue flash sparked somewhere on the street when a tuk-tuk rolled through a deep puddle. No one looked up. The city had learned what he had not: some systems only work by ignoring their own fragility.\n\nHe went back downstairs, wet from the rain and from his own sweat, and felt a small, shameful relief at the fluorescent light and the hallway’s stale air. At least inside, the danger had a shape.\n\nHe sat in the common room and tried to tether his laptop to his phone. The connection spun, then stalled. The WiFi icon flashed and vanished. He stared at the router’s lone blinking light like it might blink out a solution. It did not. He opened his voicemail and listened to his own message to his mother, the one that said nothing. It was exactly as hollow as he had feared. He deleted it, not because she would hear it—she already had—but because he didn’t want to listen to it again.\n\nIn the hallway, the power flickered. A chorus of groans rose from the common room. The lights came back with a stutter. Someone clapped. Marcus did not. He looked at his phone battery, watched it drop another percent. He told himself he would go to the co-working space tomorrow. He told himself he would pay for a real outlet. He told himself he would stop doing this to himself.\n+
---

The rain started at dusk and did not stop. It hammered the tin awning with a regular, punishing beat, a metronome for bad decisions. The hostel filled with bodies again, wet and loud and determined to drink the weather away. Marcus stayed on his bunk with his laptop open and his phone dying, trying to answer emails that weren't there. He refreshed his inbox until the refresh wheel felt like a joke told at his expense.

At 9:46, his phone buzzed with a voicemail from a number he recognized and a name he wanted to avoid. Alan. He stared at the screen until it went dark, then brought it back and listened.

“Marcus, it’s Alan,” the message said. “Just a reminder that the interest payment is due Friday. I need to hear from you. Call me back.” The tone was the same as before: polite, tired, final.

Marcus closed his eyes and tried to breathe through the panic that spiked in his chest. The fan clicked overhead. The hallway light flickered. The rain slammed the roof. He felt the old reflex to problem-solve, to find the lever that would make the machine do what he needed. He did not have a lever. He had a charger, a damp bathroom, and a laptop that was slowly draining the last of his calm.

He opened the notes app and tried to draft a script for the call back, the kind of bullet list he could cling to. “Acknowledgment. Apology. Timeline. Ask for extension.” He wrote it out and stared at the words like they were supposed to become a plan by sheer proximity. They didn't. He deleted the list and opened his bank app instead, because the numbers felt more honest than his own intentions. The balance stared back at him, small and shrinking. He closed it quickly, as if the app could see his cowardice and report it.

His thoughts drifted, uninvited, to his parents’ house in Cupertino: the quiet kitchen, the fruit bowl, his father at the table with a laptop that never ran out of battery. He remembered the last time he had been there, the way his mother had touched his shoulder and asked, softly, “Are you eating?” He had laughed, as if the question itself was a joke. He wondered now if the joke was on him or if it had always been there, waiting for the punchline to land.

He picked up the phone and hovered over Alan’s number. His thumb shook. He imagined the call: the polite voice on the other end, the request for a number he didn't have, the silence that would follow. He let the phone dim and pulled his thumb back. He told himself he would call after he charged, after he had a plan, after he had something to offer besides a voicemail and a promise. He told himself that it was strategic. He told himself, as he had all week, that waiting was the same as preparing.

He reached into his bag and pulled out the cheap power bank. It was dead. He pressed the button. Nothing. He shook it once, a single angry motion, and the light flickered briefly before dying again. He laughed out loud, a short, sharp sound that startled the compass-tattoo guy in the lower bunk. The guy looked up, saw Marcus's face, and looked away.

Marcus sat very still for a long moment. He could have gone to the co-working space in the morning. He could have asked to borrow a power bank. He could have called his mother with a dying phone and let the call fail. He could have done anything that wasn't this. He did what he always did when a system refused to cooperate: he forced it.

He stood, grabbed his laptop and charger, and went downstairs.

The common room was a low roar. The air smelled of rum and sweat and wet clothes. A British guy was yelling “CHEERS” at no one. A woman in a silver dress was crying into a plastic cup. Marcus slipped through the bodies with his laptop held above the chaos, as if it could keep him clean.

He passed the reception desk. Bee glanced up, saw the charger in his hand, and looked away. He didn’t meet her eyes. It felt too much like permission.

He reached the bathroom door and stopped. The NO CHARGING sign was still there, still crooked. The tape had peeled further, and the paper sagged in the humidity like it was tired of its own job. He touched it with two fingers. The paper was warm.

He pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The puddle was bigger. It covered the entire floor now, a shallow sheet that reached the base of the toilet and lapped against the bottom of the door. The light buzzed like a trapped insect. The air was thick with the smell of bleach and a sharper, ozone sting that made his sinuses flare. The outlet sat in the wall like a tired eye, its crack darker than before, a thin line of corroded wire exposed behind the plate.

He set the laptop on the sink. He uncoiled the charger. He told himself he would be in and out, ten minutes, just enough to get the phone above ten percent, enough to make a call that mattered. He told himself he was doing what he had to do. He told himself that had always been his story.

The adapter slid into the outlet with a soft click. A blue flash lit the crack for an instant, sharp and bright. The fluorescent light overhead flickered in response. The charger light glowed green. The outlet hummed, a high, thin whine that made his teeth ache.

He stepped into the water. It was warmer than before, as if it had been sitting under the light too long. It wrapped around his ankles. He felt the familiar tingle at the base of his feet, a soft fizz under the skin. He shifted his weight. The tingle followed.

He connected his phone to the laptop and watched the battery creep from zero to one. He watched it like it was an IV drip. He opened his email anyway, because if he could not fix his life he could at least witness its failures in real time.

The WiFi bars held at two. The cursor blinked. The hum in the outlet rose and fell like a breath. The rain hammered the roof. The water on the floor rippled with each gust of wind pushing the building. He could smell burning plastic now, faint but real. He told himself it was the charger warming up.

He opened a new message to his mother and typed, I’m sorry. He stared at it, then deleted it. He typed, Can you talk? He deleted that too. He typed, Hi Mom. He left it, as if a greeting could be a plan.

The light flickered again, longer this time. The charger light wavered but stayed on. The hum in the outlet sharpened. The tingle in his feet moved up his calves, a fizzing that felt like static and something more. He lifted one foot and set it down again. The sensation didn't fade. It spread.

He should have left. He should have pulled the plug. He should have listened to every warning sign that had been taped, spoken, implied. He didn't. He watched the phone tick to three percent and told himself he would go at five.

The rain outside surged, a sudden violent burst. The light strobed once, twice. The outlet crackled, louder now, a dry, snapping sound from inside the wall. The smell of ozone thickened, sharp and clean and wrong. Marcus swallowed, his mouth dry. His hands had started to sweat even in the damp heat.

Five percent.

He reached for the charger cable.

The light flickered.

The hum rose into a whine.

And the water around his feet shivered as if the floor itself had begun to wake up.

---

He froze with his hand on the cord, listening to the building breathe, the rain pound, the outlet sing its thin, hungry note. The number on his phone crawled upward, indifferent. The puddle clung to his ankles like a question.

Marcus held his breath and told himself, just one more percent.
