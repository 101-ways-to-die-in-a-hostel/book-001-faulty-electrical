# Chapter 03: Buffering

Marcus slept with his laptop on his chest like a defibrillator, a warm slab of aluminum pressing into his sternum, and woke to the buzzing fluorescence as if it were the sound of his own brain trying to keep a signal.

---

He came up out of a shallow, sweaty sleep sometime after three, when the dorm had thinned to a few mouths breathing in the dark. The ceiling fan had slowed to a lazy wobble, pushing humid air around like it was too tired to be useful. The room smelled of damp sheets and deodorant, the faint chemical lemon of the hostel disinfectant, and a trace of alcohol that had evaporated but not left. It clung to the metal bunks the way disappointment clung to his ribs.

His phone lay face down on the thin mattress, the screen a dim rectangle of missed possibilities. He flicked it on, eyes squinting at the glow. No reply from Matt. No new likes on his last post. The battery was at six percent. He frowned as if a facial expression could change a number.

He set the laptop on the bed and stared at it like it might explain itself. It was down to nine percent too, though he had charged it twice. That made no sense unless the battery was dying. Or unless it had been drawing power in a way that was inefficient, a slow leak in the system. Marcus catalogued the variables. Wet environment. Cheap wiring. Unstable current. He opened his notes app and typed: electrical fluctuation > battery drain? He tagged it with a little lightbulb emoji, which made him feel like he was still thinking in the right language.

Across the room, Chang Tank Top snored in a rhythm that sounded like an oscillating fan. Elise’s phone lit briefly inside the mosquito netting, then dimmed again. She was probably awake too, or asleep with her screen on. Either way, she had a power bank. Marcus did not.

He sat up, the laptop sliding down to his lap. The room was quiet enough to hear the building breathe. The electrical hum from the hallway was a constant, a thin insect whine that you could only notice once you tried to sleep. A pipe somewhere glugged like it was swallowing water. The monsoon pressed against the window as if it wanted in.

Marcus thumbed his phone. There was a message from his sister, Lina, a short line of text sent hours earlier: You okay? Mom’s worried. Call when you can.

He stared at it, then at the cracked ceiling, then at the text again. He pictured Lina’s face, the way she would tilt her head when she thought he was lying. He imagined calling her and saying, I’m fine, Bangkok is amazing, I’m about to close a bridge round. He imagined her saying, No you’re not. He imagined both versions and picked the one where he did nothing.

He closed the message without replying. It wasn’t because he didn’t care. It was because he cared too much and did not trust himself to be anything but honest if he opened his mouth. Honest would sound like weak, and weakness in his mind was not a feeling, it was a product flaw.

He slid out of the bunk and padded across the dorm, bare feet on the gritty tile. The hallway was dim. The lights flickered every few seconds, each flicker like a tiny warning. He moved down the stairs toward the common room, hugging his laptop to his chest as if it could keep him company.

The common room was half-lit, a low blue glow from the TV and a strip of neon leaking in from outside. A British guy asleep on a couch had his mouth open, a plastic cup balanced on his thigh. The ring-light girl was still awake, sitting on the floor with her back against the wall, headphones on, editing something with her phone's brightness turned all the way down. Her eyes were red, her face illuminated by the flicker of a timeline. In the kitchen, the water dispenser gurgled like an old stomach.

Marcus felt a sudden, stupid urge to say something to her, some line about content pipelines and sustainable output. He kept walking. He had no business advising strangers about production when he couldn't produce a single viable revenue stream.

At the reception desk, Bee was asleep with her head on her arms. Her phone lay in front of her, still on, the screen showing a paused drama. The bars on the desk cast shadows across her face like prison bars. Marcus stood there a moment, watching the gentle rise and fall of her shoulders. It made him feel like a thief even though he hadn't taken anything.

He tried connecting to the WiFi. Zero bars. He raised his phone toward the ceiling. One bar appeared, then vanished. He angled it toward the stairwell. A thin bar flickered, then dropped. He lowered the phone, feeling a childish desire to throw it at the wall. Instead, he opened his laptop, letting it wake with its soft chime, and tried to tether. The phone spun. The laptop spun. The spinning wheels on both devices matched, a pair of small, synchronized failures.

He walked to the wall where the router was taped like a tiny hostage. It had one blinking green light. A handwritten note above it read: PLEASE DO NOT RESET. Someone had underlined the word PLEASE three times. Marcus thought about pressing the tiny hole with a paperclip anyway. He imagined the chaos that would follow, the hostel going dark, the staff blaming him, the WiFi briefly restarting like a dying animal. He imagined the comment thread on Hostelworld, how it would read: "Some American guy bricked the WiFi." He left it alone.

He turned back toward the hallway. The ground-floor bathroom door was closed. The NO CHARGING sign hung there like a tiny do-not-enter sign on a haunted house. His body moved toward it anyway, because his mind had already negotiated the terms: just a quick check, no charging, just see if the signal is up. He told himself this was rational. He told himself he had zero tolerance for superstition.

Inside, the bathroom was a womb of damp and hum. The fluorescent light made the tile look green. The puddle had spread, reflecting the light in a rippled patch. He took out his phone and watched the bars climb to two. The signal steadied. He felt his shoulders release.

He didn’t plug in anything. He wasn’t that desperate. Not yet. He opened his inbox and refreshed. Still no response. The email he had sent to Matt sat there like a coin dropped into a well.

Marcus leaned against the wall and breathed in. The air smelled of bleach, mildew, and a faint metallic sharpness that reminded him of opening a new laptop box, that sterile, electric smell. He wondered if that was just in his head. He wondered if he was the kind of person who could smell voltage. He smiled at the thought. It made him feel like a founder again, someone with special perception.

From the hallway, a voice floated in, slurred. "Mate, I swear the charger bit me." Laughter, then the sound of footsteps moving away.

Marcus rolled his eyes. “It’s just a cheap adapter,” he muttered, and realized he had said it aloud. The bathroom held the words and echoed them back in the buzz of the light.

He checked his battery. Five percent. The WiFi bars dipped. He closed his phone. He didn’t want to know. He left the bathroom, leaving the puddle, leaving the sign, leaving the hum behind.

Back upstairs, he crawled into his bunk, the fan overhead clicking, the room heavy with heat. He placed the laptop on the pillow beside him like a sleeping pet and closed his eyes. His mind insisted on running: a loop of variables, a churn of what-ifs. He pictured the investor reading his email and laughing. He pictured his parents reading a lawsuit. He pictured himself, in another hostel, somewhere else, still chasing the same signal. He thought about the outlet in the bathroom, the blue flash, the pop. He told himself it was normal. He told himself he was in control.

The power flickered once at four twenty-nine. The fan slowed, then resumed. The room went quiet, then loud again. Marcus didn’t fully wake, but his body registered the fluctuation, a tiny spike of fear like static in his veins.

He slept for another hour, if it could be called sleep.

---

Morning at The Backpacker’s Byte was a slow-motion accident. At ten, the common room filled with people wearing the same expression Marcus had worn in college after an all-nighter: glazed, resentful, vaguely impressed by their own survival. The air smelled like instant coffee and fried eggs and the lingering ghost of last night’s rum buckets. The ceiling fan pushed it around without conviction.

Marcus descended the stairs in a clean merino tee and the same Allbirds, looking like someone who had gotten up early to do yoga even though he had not. His eyes were bloodshot and his head felt packed with damp cotton. He drank a full bottle of water in three gulps, feeling it hit his stomach with a cold slap. His Whoop band vibrated and announced LOW RECOVERY. He ignored it.

Breakfast was laid out on a plastic table: white bread, jam packets, a tub of butter sweating in the heat. A stack of bananas had bruises. There was a sign that said FREE TOAST, PLEASE CLEAN KNIFE. The toaster was a small, old unit that looked like it had seen wars. Marcus watched it spark when someone pushed the lever down. The tiny flash was almost comical. He felt a brief itch behind his eyes.

He made toast because he needed calories, because it was free, because he could pretend he was optimizing his day by choosing carbs over cost. He ate standing up at the edge of the common room, watching the crowd. The ring-light girl filmed her breakfast and tried to make the toast look aspirational. The British handstand guy apologized to the wall for something he didn’t remember. A pair of Danish backpackers argued about a tour pickup time. The air buzzed with hangover language, a collective groan.

Marcus opened his laptop on the sticky counter and tried to connect. The WiFi refused. He tethered his phone, which was at twelve percent. It connected for five seconds, then dropped. He stared at the spinning wheel and felt his jaw tighten. He turned his head to the wall and saw the router blinking like a single tired eye.

Bee appeared behind the desk, hair tied back, a cup of instant coffee in her hand. She looked at Marcus the way a barista looks at someone who has already asked for a refill twice.

“It’s bad today,” he said, as if reporting weather. “The WiFi is down?”

“It is slow,” she said.

“It is dead,” he said. He kept his voice light, as if he were still helpful. “Have you considered upgrading the router? You could get a mesh system for under two thousand baht. It would improve coverage, reduce dropouts, and—”

Bee raised one eyebrow. It was a small movement, but it said, You again.

“We have Internet company,” she said. “We pay. They come sometimes.”

“Right, but you could do a local network overlay. It’s a cheap fix. I can set it up if you want.” He smiled, because in his head, offering to fix things made him useful.

Bee took a sip of coffee. “We do not touch. The owner does not like.” She glanced toward the back, toward the STAFF ONLY door. “Please do not touch.”

Marcus nodded, accepting the soft no. He glanced toward the bathroom door out of habit. The NO CHARGING sign was still there, taped at an angle. The mop bucket beside it was full, a small lake of cloudy water. Somchai, the older cleaner, was wringing out a mop with slow, methodical strength. His face was unreadable. The floor near the bathroom was already wet. It would never not be wet.

Marcus swallowed and tried to focus on his toast. He opened his email again. Still nothing from Matt. He opened his LinkedIn notifications and felt a small, sad thrill at a new follower, then realized it was a bot selling SEO services. He closed it.

He remembered his sister’s text and felt a stab of guilt. He considered replying with a single emoji. He decided against it. Emojis were lazy. He could do better when he had a real update.

He took his laptop upstairs and tried the outlet by his bunk. He plugged in his charger. Nothing happened. He wiggled it. A faint crackle came from inside the wall. He pulled the plug out again. The prongs were warm. He frowned, then stepped back and looked at the outlet like it had insulted him.

Elise was packing her bag, pulling clothes out of her netting cave. She held up a pair of flip-flops. “You staying long?” she asked.

“Week,” he said. “Maybe longer.” He didn’t add that his credit card would decide.

“Brave.” She smirked. “You should get a power bank. Everyone here has one. The power is… moody.”

“It’s fine,” he said. He forced the smile. “I can handle it.”

“Sure.” She shrugged. “You can handle everything.” It wasn’t unkind. It was tired.

Marcus watched her shoulder a daypack and leave. He felt an odd pang, a tiny jealousy at her mobility, her casual acceptance that things were unpredictable. He prided himself on being adaptable, but he realized he only liked adaptation when he was in control of it.

He went down to the kitchen again, because the WiFi, like gravity, was better near the ground. There was one bar near the window. He squatted there, laptop on his knees, and tried to send a follow-up to Matt. The email stalled. He tried again. The spin wheel laughed.

“Try the bathroom,” said the sunburned guy with the nose ring, sliding past with a cup of coffee. “It’s weird, but it works.” He said it like someone offering a pro tip, not a warning. Marcus nodded.

Before he could move, the power flickered. The overhead lights dimmed to orange, then went out. A chorus of groans rose from the common room. A British voice called, “Not again,” in a tone that suggested it had indeed been again. The power stayed out for longer this time, maybe twenty seconds. The toaster clicked in the dark like a tiny gun. When the lights returned, they did so with a flash that made everyone blink.

Marcus rubbed his eyes. The WiFi remained dead. He closed his laptop and slid it under his arm like a document case, then walked toward the bathroom.

Inside, the light was on. It buzzed. The puddle was wider, a thin sheet of water covering more of the tile, glossy and still. Somchai had mopped in here recently, leaving the floor slick. Marcus stood in the doorway and checked his phone. Two bars. He exhaled.

He had not brought his charger. He had learned, if nothing else, to limit risk when the payoff was just a notification. He opened his email, refreshed. Still nothing. He checked his sent message. It said Delivered. That was something. He leaned against the wall and waited for a reply that did not come.

He stared at the NO CHARGING sign and read it like a challenge. The ink had faded slightly, the tape peeling. He imagined, for a second, peeling it off, flattening the paper, turning it into a joke. He imagined replacing it with a printed, laminated, professionally designed notice. He imagined sending the design to the owner as a suggestion, because if you couldn’t fix the wiring, you could at least fix the signage. He imagined being thanked. He imagined being paid. He imagined everything except being told to leave.

He left the bathroom without charging anything and told himself it counted as restraint.

In the afternoon, the rain eased into a heavy, humid drizzle. Marcus went to the rooftop to see if the WiFi had improved. The air up there was thick, smelling of wet concrete and hot garbage from the street. He stood under the sagging string of fairy lights and held his phone toward the sky. One bar flickered, then died. A gecko chirped from the wall. The tangle of overhead wires across the street sagged as if tired. It struck him that the wires looked like veins, black and knotted, carrying current to a city that refused to rest.

He checked his email again. Still nothing. He hit refresh out of habit, like pressing an elevator button twice.

He went downstairs, past the STAFF ONLY door, and felt the faint hum again, like a refrigerator working overtime. He paused. The door was closed, but he could smell damp concrete and metal. It felt like the building’s heart was down there, beating in the dark.

He returned to the common room and found the WiFi still dead. He tethered his phone and tried to send a last follow-up. The phone heated in his hand, the battery dropping to eight percent. He felt the same low panic, a tiny animal in his chest scratching at the walls.

He considered buying a local SIM. He considered walking to a café. He considered walking to a co-working space with real WiFi and air conditioning and people who weren’t hungover teenagers. He considered spending money. His account balance flashed in his mind like a warning light.

He opened his notes app and typed another line: Don’t confuse scarcity with strategy. He underlined it twice. He didn’t know what it meant, but it felt like something a mentor would say on a podcast. It made him feel less alone.

---

The email from Matt arrived at five thirty-five, when the sky had turned the color of wet concrete and the air felt like soup. Marcus was in the common room, laptop on his knees, watching the WiFi icon like a cardiologist watches a flat line.

Subject: Re: Bangkok

It was one line, a small mercy that still made his pulse jump.

Can do 15 min tonight. 11:30 PM your time. Need to see numbers. Call me.

Marcus read it twice, then a third time, then held the laptop away from his face as if to confirm the letters were real. A laugh escaped him, short and sharp, half relief, half panic. He closed his eyes and felt the adrenaline surge through his hands. Eleven-thirty. He had time. He had an appointment. He had an actual moment to perform.

He had to make it count.

He checked his battery. Eight percent. He checked his phone. Eleven percent. He checked his charger. He checked the outlet by the window, still dead. He felt the walls close in, a tightening in his chest, a sense that all of this rested on a battery icon.

He went to Bee at the desk. “Is the power in the rooms better now?” he asked.

Bee shook her head. “Same. Sometimes.”

“Any other outlets? The bathroom one seems to work.”

Her eyes sharpened. “No charging in bathroom.”

“I’m not charging,” he lied. “I just need the WiFi.”

Bee’s gaze held on him for a second longer than was comfortable. “The floor is wet,” she said. “Very wet when rain. Please do not.”

“Got it,” he said, smiling. “I’ll be careful.”

He went back upstairs and opened his bag. He pulled out his charger, the white cable coiled like a question mark. He considered buying a power bank from the corner shop. He considered borrowing one. He considered asking the German girls, the French guys, the man-bun. He could not bring himself to ask. Asking meant admitting he was not prepared.

He spent the next hour trying to find a viable charging spot. The outlet near the stairwell made a faint popping sound when he plugged in. He unplugged it. The outlet in the common room had a line of people charging phones like pilgrims at a shrine. He stood behind them for five minutes, then left. He went to the kitchen and tried the outlet behind the toaster. The toaster sparked and the charger light blinked once, then died. He felt his jaw clench until it hurt.

At seven, the rain began again, a steady drumming on the tin awning. The power flickered twice in three minutes. The WiFi signal disappeared completely. The hostel filled with bodies, laughter, music, the pre-game energy rising like humidity. Marcus sat on the edge of his bunk, staring at the battery icons, calculating percentages like runway lengths.

He opened his calendar and set a reminder for eleven. He closed it. He opened it again. He needed to know that it existed. He needed to believe that he would be ready.

The hours crawled. He killed time by drafting bullet points for the call: traction (explain why it’s down), runway (don’t mention lawsuits), pivot (say “expansion”), product (say “platform”). He rehearsed. He practiced saying “strategic bridge” without sounding like he was begging.

At nine thirty, his phone buzzed again. A new message from Lina. Just a thumbs-up emoji, a tiny concession. He felt a prickle behind his eyes. He responded with a single line: All good. Call soon. He hit send before he could change his mind.

At ten fifteen, the power cut out entirely for almost a minute. The dorm went dark. The fan stopped. The air went still. Somewhere in the hallway, someone yelled. Marcus sat in the dark and listened to his own heartbeat, loud and irregular. When the power returned, the fan shuddered back to life. The lights flickered like nervous laughter.

At ten forty-five, he took his laptop and his charger and went downstairs. The common room was loud now, the music thumping, the air thick with sweat and alcohol. People pressed around the honor-system fridge, pouring beers into plastic cups. He slipped through them like a ghost.

The bathroom door was closed. The NO CHARGING sign hung at an angle. He stood there for a second, looking at it, then at the time on his phone. Ten forty-seven. He had forty-three minutes. The battery was at five percent.

He opened the door and stepped inside.

The room was hotter than before, a humid box of tile and buzzing light. The puddle covered most of the floor now, a shallow, reflective sheet. It reached the base of the toilet. He could see the drain, a dark eye clogged with hair. The sink was wet. The mirror was fogged. The smell of bleach was stronger, mixed with a metallic tang. The outlet sat in the wall, scorched, waiting.

He set the laptop on the sink. It didn’t fit well; he had to angle it, one corner over the edge. He uncoiled the charger and held the adapter in his hand. The plastic felt slightly warm, or maybe his palm was just sweaty. He paused, listening to the hum of the light, to the distant thump of music, to the rain.

He thought about Bee’s warning. He thought about his mother’s voice saying electricity isn’t forgiving. He thought about Alan’s line: You have debt and a laptop. He thought about Matt’s email. He thought about Lina’s thumbs-up. He thought about how ridiculous it would be to die in a hostel bathroom with a MacBook, how he would become a punchline, a cautionary tale, a tweet.

He smiled, because the thought was absurd and because smiling was easier than admitting fear.

He plugged the adapter into the outlet.

A small blue flash sparked inside the plate. The light flickered. The charger light blinked green. He exhaled, more sharply than he intended, and felt the tiny relief of a system accepting his input. He told himself it was fine. He told himself he would be careful. He told himself he would only be here for forty minutes.

The water touched his toes. Cool, slick. He shifted his weight so his feet were on a drier patch, which only moved the water around. He ignored the dampness creeping up his arches. He focused on the battery indicator, watching it climb from five to six to seven like a slow, reluctant heartbeat.

Outside, the rain hit the awning in sheets. The light above him buzzed. The outlet hummed. The building, somewhere in its gut, made a low, steady sound, like a fuse pulling breath.

Marcus opened the email from Matt and started to rehearse his answer, the words lined up like soldiers. Eleven thirty was coming. The WiFi bars held at two. The power held. For now.

He told himself he had solved it.

He didn’t see the puddle widening.

He didn’t hear the tiny crackle behind the wall.

He didn’t notice the way the light flickered in time with his pulse.

He watched the battery tick up to nine percent and decided it would be enough.
