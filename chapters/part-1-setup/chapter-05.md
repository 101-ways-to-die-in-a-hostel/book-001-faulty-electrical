# Chapter 05: Power Cycle

The charger smelled like pennies and burnt plastic, which was a weird thing to notice first thing in the morning, but Marcus did notice it, and then pretended he hadn't.

He woke to the fan clicking above him, a tired metronome that couldn't decide if it was spinning or sighing. The dorm was an aquarium of heat. Damp sheets stuck to his skin like a second layer he hadn't consented to. Somewhere below, a toilet flushed with the confidence of a waterfall, and then the pipes gurgled like they regretted it. The fluorescent hallway light buzzed through the door crack, making the edges of the room pulse.

His laptop was on the bunk beside him, still warm, still humming faintly as if it hadn't slept either. The battery read twenty-four percent. He had left it at twenty, and the numbers should have been stable, but the icon had dropped, then climbed, then dropped again overnight in the way only hostel electricity could achieve. He should have unplugged it. He hadn't. He imagined, without wanting to, a tiny cigarette-burn dot on the power adapter and the way it had smelled when he picked it up.

His phone was dead. A black screen, an object without purpose. He tapped it anyway. Nothing. It felt like poking a body to see if it would breathe.

He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling stain that looked like an upside-down map of a country he couldn't name. The edges of it were darker now than they had been yesterday. Water liked to spread, he thought, and then immediately hated himself for thinking it. Everything in his head turned into a metaphor whether he asked for it or not. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, checked his Whoop band, and got a LOW RECOVERY alert that felt like the most honest notification he had received all week.

Elise's bunk was empty. The mosquito netting hung like a discarded veil. Someone in the lower bed snored softly, the chainsaw replaced by a steady, rhythmic rasp. A British guy in the far corner muttered a sentence to no one, turned over, and went quiet again. The room smelled like wet clothes and stale beer and the lemon disinfectant that tried, and failed, to erase it.

Marcus sat up. He unplugged the charger and watched the green light blink out. The adapter felt warm in his hand. He held it by the cord, pinched the plastic, smelled it again. It was faint, barely there, but unmistakable: hot metal, a hint of ozone. He told himself it was just residual heat from charging, because that was a story he could live with. He coiled the charger and tucked it into his bag like hiding a mistake.

He needed a plan. He needed a shower. He needed a signal. The word signal had come to mean something broader than bars on a screen. It meant hope, opportunity, proof that he still existed in the economy of attention.

He checked the time on his laptop. 8:03 AM. The call had been last night. The fallout was still settling in his chest. He opened his email and saw nothing new. He clicked refresh anyway. The wheel spun, then stopped. The inbox was quiet. It felt like standing in a hallway after a door had closed.

He climbed down from his bunk and stepped into the hallway. The tile was cool, damp at the edges. The fluorescent lights flickered in uneven intervals, a nervous stutter that made his eyes ache. He walked toward the stairs and passed the STAFF ONLY door. It was shut, but the same low hum seeped from behind it, a steady mechanical breath that made his skin tighten. He kept walking.

The common room was half-awake. A few early risers slumped on couches, nursing instant coffee and regret. The TV played a music video on mute, bright colors with no sound. The air smelled like burnt toast and damp backpack. Someone had left the honor-system fridge open, its weak cold air spilling into the room like a sigh. The router on the wall blinked its solitary green light, still taped in place like a hostage.

Bee was behind the desk, hair tied back, eyes fixed on her phone. Her sweatshirt said ACCOUNTING IS MY SUPERPOWER, which felt both ironic and accurate. Marcus leaned on the bars and waited until she looked up.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning," she replied, without committing to it.

"Quick question. Do you know anywhere nearby with reliable WiFi? Like, a co-working space? Cafe?" He tried to sound casual, as if he was asking about a museum.

Bee shrugged. "Many cafe have. Starbucks on Khao San. Co-work on Samsen Road. But expensive."

"Expensive like..."

She made a small circle with her fingers. "Day pass maybe four hundred baht." She said it like it was either nothing or everything.

Marcus did a quick mental conversion and calculated how many days of food that represented. He told himself the math was irrelevant because this was an investment. "Okay," he said. "Thanks."

He paused. "Also, is the power more stable today?"

Bee's eyes flicked up toward the ceiling as if she could see the wiring through the floors. "Same. Rain all week."

"Right." He nodded, then, because he couldn't stop himself, added, "If the owner ever wants to upgrade the router, I can help. It's a cheap fix."

Bee blinked slowly. "The owner doesn't like change."

Marcus laughed, because he didn't know what else to do. "He should."

She didn't. Her eyes went back to her phone. Conversation over.

He drifted toward the kitchen, grabbed a piece of toast, and hovered near the window. The WiFi bars on his laptop held at one, a weak pulse. He opened an email draft and typed a note to himself: find co-working space, buy power bank, call mom. The third item sat there, useless and real.

Someone at the toaster pushed the lever down and it sparked, the tiny flash like a warning shot. Marcus flinched and pretended he had not. The toaster popped a minute later, smoking slightly. The person laughed. The building laughed with it, a low electrical hum in the walls.

He finished his toast and walked outside.

The morning heat hit him like a blanket soaked in breath. Khao San Road was already loud: tuk-tuks coughing, vendors shouting, scooters weaving through puddles left by the night rain. The air smelled of fish sauce and exhaust and wet asphalt. A monk in orange robes moved through the crowd, receiving alms with a calm that made everyone around him look frantic by comparison. Marcus stepped around a cart selling mango sticky rice and resisted the urge to calculate its margins.

He walked toward Samsen Road, because four hundred baht felt like a punch but also like oxygen. He passed a tangle of electrical wires hanging between poles like a nest of black vines. Water dripped from them, glinting in the light. A gust of wind made them sway. He imagined the current inside, the invisible river, and felt his shoulders tighten.

A man in a bright floral shirt stepped into his path. "Power bank? Charger? Good price," he said, holding out a plastic-wrapped brick of black and silver.

Marcus almost laughed. The universe was nothing if not on-brand. He took the power bank, turned it over in his hands. The packaging promised 50,000 mAh, which was either a miracle or a lie. Probably both. The plastic felt light, too light. He looked at the vendor. "How much?"

"Eight hundred." The man smiled like a shark.

"Two hundred," Marcus said, because it felt like a negotiation and therefore like control.

The man laughed. "Five hundred. Good one."

Marcus considered it. He had never been good at haggling because he always believed he deserved what he wanted, which made him a terrible negotiator and an easy target. He held the power bank again, felt the cheapness. He pictured it charging his phone, his laptop, his ego. He said, "Three hundred."

The man sighed dramatically. "Okay, special price. Three fifty."

Marcus could have pushed. He didn't. He handed over the bills and took the power bank. It was probably a brick full of sand, but he wanted to believe in cheap miracles. He wanted to believe in any miracle.

At the co-working space, the air conditioning hit him like a religious experience. The space was all smooth wood, potted plants, and white walls with motivational typography. A sign above the desk said HUSTLE KINDER. He paid the day fee and was given a sticker. The WiFi was fast, the chairs were ergonomic, and the air smelled faintly of coffee rather than mold. He could have cried.

He set up at a desk near a window and opened his laptop. The battery climbed, the bars held at full. His phone came back to life on the new power bank, its black screen brightening like a revived animal. He checked his messages. Nothing from Matt. A line from Lina: Did you talk to him? He stared at it, then closed the phone. His throat tightened, a small rope of guilt.

He opened his bank app because he couldn't help himself. The numbers were smaller than they had been yesterday. Everything was smaller than yesterday. He closed it and opened his deck. He made edits that he told himself were substantial: a new slide with a revenue plan, a prettier chart, a sentence changed from could to will. He worked for three hours, because the act of working was the only thing that made him feel less like a failed mascot. The co-working space buzzed with other people tapping, scrolling, doing the same performance of productivity. He fit in here. That bothered him.

He sent a follow-up email to Matt with the updated slide. He CC'd no one. He felt the tiny relief of hitting send on a stable connection, the way you might feel releasing a breath in a room with oxygen. He checked his inbox for a reply too soon and got nothing. He checked again anyway.

At noon, the monsoon returned. Rain slammed against the window in sheets, blurring the street into watercolor. The power flickered once, and the co-working space hummed on, its backup generator catching the dip before it became a dark. Marcus flinched anyway. He couldn't unlearn the hostel's nervous system.

He left his laptop open and went to the kitchenette for water. The place offered complimentary cold brew that tasted like it had been brewed in regret. He poured a cup anyway. A girl with a nose ring sat at the bar typing furiously on a mechanical keyboard, the clacks like a metronome for her ambition. A guy in a linen shirt was on a call, saying synergy so often it started to sound like a prayer. Marcus watched them and felt a thin, unpleasant kinship. It was the same theater, just with better lighting.

He took his coffee back to the desk and opened his messages. Lina's text stared back at him: Please call Mom. He thumbed the phone screen, hesitated, then tapped her name. The call rang once, twice, then clicked into voicemail. He didn't leave a message. He didn't want his voice preserved in a place he couldn't edit. He hung up and felt the small, hollow shame of trying and failing in a matter of seconds.

To atone, he opened his notes app and typed a draft he would never send: Mom, things are messy but I'm okay. It read like a status update. He deleted it, then retyped: Mom, I'm not okay. He deleted that too. He wrote: Call you soon. He left it, because it was at least possible.

He tried to work after that, but the cursor blinked like it was waiting for him to be someone else. He flipped through old decks on his hard drive, the ones with shiny traction graphs and photos of smiling users. Each slide felt like a fossil. He closed them and returned to the new deck, replacing a chart with another chart and pretending the difference mattered. His stomach was empty, but hunger felt like a luxury.

At one, the power flickered again, a quick stutter. The co-working space did not notice. Marcus did. He closed his laptop and waited for the hum of the backup generator to settle. He told himself he was being paranoid. He checked his phone again, as if paranoia could be smoothed by data. The battery read 68% from the power bank, but he didn't trust the number. Cheap miracles had a way of rounding up.

He packed up in the afternoon, because he couldn't justify staying longer when his bank balance flashed like a warning. He walked back through the wet heat, past the vendors, past the monks, past the wires. The power bank in his bag was heavier now, or maybe he was just paying more attention to its weight.

He stopped at a street cart to buy a bowl of noodles, the vendor scooping broth that smelled of garlic and star anise. Marcus ate standing up, sweat sliding down his spine, and watched the vendor flick a switch to turn on a small light beneath the cart. It sputtered twice before it caught. The vendor shrugged, slapped the side of the battery with a practiced palm, and the light steadied. A drunk tourist nearby joked about the power being \"haunted,\" and the vendor smiled politely without laughing. Marcus heard the sputter and felt it land in his chest like a coin in a jar.

By the time he returned to The Backpacker's Byte, the hallway smelled like damp laundry and something fried. The common room had refilled with bodies. The TV was showing a football match with the volume off. The router blinked its tired light. Bee looked up when he entered and nodded once, as if to say, you came back.

He went upstairs and plugged the power bank into the outlet by his bunk. The bank's indicator light came on, a steady blue dot. He exhaled. The outlet crackled softly. The light on the power bank blinked twice, then held. It felt like a tiny victory. He set the power bank on the bed, turned away, and tried not to notice the faint warmth coming from the adapter.

Elise wasn't there. Her bed remained empty, the netting slightly swaying with the fan. A new backpacker had taken the lower bunk, a guy with a mop of blond hair and a tattoo of a compass on his calf. He glanced at Marcus's laptop and nodded like they were in the same cult.

"WiFi any good?" the guy asked.

"It's a spectrum," Marcus said.

The guy laughed. "Bathroom, right?"

Marcus smiled without humor. "Bathroom."

He opened his laptop and tried to connect. The WiFi bars hovered at one. He moved closer to the window. Two bars. He stayed there, perched on the edge of his bunk like a bird, and watched his inbox. Nothing. He checked his phone again. Lina had sent another message: Please call Mom. She just wants to hear you. He stared at it and felt a heat behind his eyes that had nothing to do with humidity.

He should have called. He didn't. He told himself he would later, when he had something positive to say. He told himself tomorrow was fine. He told himself a lot of things.

The power flickered in the hallway. The fan slowed, then resumed. The power bank's blue light blinked once and steadied. Marcus rubbed his temples. The day had been a loop: find signal, send message, wait, repeat. He was a subscription service to his own anxiety.

He went downstairs in the early evening with the power bank in his pocket. He sat in the common room, tried the WiFi again, and found it dead. He watched other travelers laugh, drink, plan. A British girl was explaining to a Canadian guy how to get cheap tickets to Chiang Mai. A French couple argued over a map. A man with a shaved head was writing in a journal like it mattered. Marcus watched them and felt like a tourist in his own life.

The power cut out for ten seconds. The room groaned, then cheered when it returned. Someone shouted, "Classic Byte!" and everyone laughed. Marcus did not. He checked the power bank. It had dropped ten percent without charging anything. He felt his jaw tighten. Cheap miracle, he thought. Cheap miracle indeed.

He went outside to the courtyard for air. The smokers were there, huddled under the eaves. The rain had paused, but the street still steamed. A gecko chirped from the wall. Marcus leaned against the damp concrete and looked at the alley. The STAFF ONLY door was open now, a sliver of the basement visible: a steep staircase, a tangle of pipes, a panel box with warning stickers. The air that drifted up smelled of wet metal and something burnt. The low hum was louder with the door open, a mechanical purr that felt like it belonged to a machine older than the building.

Somchai appeared behind him, mop in hand. He glanced at the open door, then at Marcus. "Not safe down there," he said. His English was slow, precise.

"Basement?" Marcus asked.

Somchai nodded. "Many wires. Old. Wet." He made a face like he was describing spoiled food.

Marcus felt the reflexive urge to suggest a fix. He swallowed it. "Yeah," he said. "I get it."

Somchai closed the door with a firm push. The hum quieted. The air felt slightly less heavy. Marcus watched the door latch and felt a new, small dread settle into his chest. He didn't understand it yet, but he recognized it as real.

He went back inside and headed toward the bathroom to wash his face. The NO CHARGING sign was still there, the edges curling in the humidity. He washed his hands and watched the water pool in the corner, a shallow mirror that never drained. The sink water ran cold, then hot, then cold again. He looked at his reflection and saw a man who had been awake for too long pretending he was rested.

He dried his face on a paper towel and went back upstairs. The power bank was at sixty percent. His phone was at fifteen. His laptop was at thirty. None of it felt like enough. He opened his email and refreshed. Still nothing. He considered writing another follow-up to Matt, then thought better of it. He closed the laptop and stared at the wall.

The night crept in with the humidity, pressing into the room. The dorm filled with bodies again, then emptied. The fan clicked and clacked. The lights flickered in their nervous rhythm. Marcus watched the ceiling stain and imagined it spreading. He imagined his debt spreading. He imagined his name shrinking.

At 10:12 PM, his phone buzzed. A new email notification. His chest tightened. He opened it.

Subject: Re: Numbers

His heart jumped. He opened the email with the same reverence he used to reserve for term sheets.

Marcus,
Thanks for the updated slide. It's a step in the right direction, but I'm not seeing a clear path to revenue in the next 30 days. Let's regroup in a month. Keep me posted if anything changes.

Best,
Matt

The words felt like a door closing gently so he couldn't argue. He read it twice, then a third time, as if repetition would change the outcome. He felt his throat tighten. He wanted to throw the phone across the room. He wanted to call Lina and say, It's over. He wanted to call his mother and say, I tried. He did nothing. He sat on the edge of his bunk and stared at the glowing screen until his eyes blurred.

He wanted to be productive, because productivity felt like virtue. He opened his notes app and typed: pivot again? He deleted it. He wrote: new idea: hostel WiFi platform? He deleted it. He wrote: get power bank that isn't fake. He left that one.

His power bank flickered and turned off. He clicked the button. The light blinked, then died. He stared at it. He shook it gently, like a remote. Nothing. He pressed it again. A weak light flickered, then went dark. The cheap miracle had died. He laughed once, short and sharp, the kind of laugh that is actually a cough.

He glanced at the charger coiled in his bag. He thought about the bathroom. He thought about Bee's warning. He thought about Somchai's face when he said not safe. He thought about his mother's voice. He thought about Matt's email. He thought about the way his battery icon was already shrinking. He thought about the only place in the building that still gave him two bars of WiFi. He didn't like it. He did it anyway.

He took the laptop, the charger, and his dead power bank and went downstairs. The common room was loud, but quieter than it had been earlier. The party energy was tapering off, the way a fire dies when it runs out of fuel. He passed the reception desk. Bee glanced up, then back down. She didn't say anything. He didn't either.

The bathroom door was closed. The NO CHARGING sign hung at eye level, its letters smudged and slightly warped. He looked at it for a long second, then opened the door.

The room was a box of damp light. The floor was wet, a thin, gleaming sheet that reflected the fluorescent glare. The drain gurgled once, then went still. The smell was stronger tonight: bleach, mildew, and something sharp like burnt plastic. The outlet was the same, cracked, scorched. The handwritten sign hung beneath it like a tired prayer.

Marcus set his laptop on the sink and uncoiled the charger. His hands felt slower than usual, heavier. The adapter slid into the outlet with a soft click. A tiny blue flash blinked inside the plate. The light above him flickered. The charger glowed green.

He stepped into the puddle, the water cool against his feet. He felt the faint tingle on his heel, the same whisper as before. He told himself it was just nerves, just static, just humidity. He told himself he would only be there long enough to send one more email, one more update, one more proof that he was trying.

He opened his laptop. The WiFi bars jumped to two, steady. He typed a note to Matt he didn't send. He typed a note to his mother he didn't send. He typed a note to Lina that said, Call you tomorrow. He hovered over send, then closed it. He didn't want to talk. He wanted to fix.

Outside, the rain started again, louder than before, an urgent drumming on the tin awning. The bathroom light buzzed harder, the sound growing more insistent. The outlet hummed. The puddle widened, a slow creep across the tile, gliding toward the door. His toes were fully submerged. He didn't move.

He checked the battery: thirty-two percent. He watched it tick to thirty-three. He watched the charger cable tremble slightly, not from his hands but from the wall. He told himself he was being paranoid. He told himself he was fine. He told himself he would leave at thirty-five.

The light flickered. The outlet crackled. A faint smell of ozone rose, sharper now, like a storm inside the wall. Marcus felt the hair on his arms lift. He swallowed. He looked at the door. He looked at the battery icon. He watched it climb, one percentage point at a time, and waited for a number that would make it feel safe to leave.

Behind him, the monsoon pressed harder. The water on the floor stirred, a thin wave from somewhere he couldn't see. The light buzzed in time with his pulse. He stood there, a man in a wet bathroom holding a laptop he had been told not to charge, waiting for a signal that felt like it might never be strong enough.

He told himself he was still in control. He told himself he would step out as soon as the battery hit thirty-five.

The outlet hummed back.
