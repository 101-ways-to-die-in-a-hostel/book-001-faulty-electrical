# Chapter 08: One More Percent

The tingle in his feet sharpened, not pain yet but a prickly insistence, and Marcus held the charger cable in his hand like a fuse he was about to cut.

He watched the battery on his phone tick from five to six, the little white bolt climbing in a puddle of light. The outlet hummed, higher now, a thin note that sat on his teeth. The fluorescent bulb above him flickered in time with the rain. The water around his ankles felt suddenly alive, a nervous skin.

Six percent.

He reached for the charger and the outlet snapped. A blue-white flash blinked behind the cracked plate. The light strobed once. The hum spiked. His fingers touched the plastic, and for a fraction of a second his hand went numb, a sharp, hot buzz that ran up his wrist and into his forearm like a live wire had licked him. It was not a Hollywood jolt. It was a small, ugly bite. It was enough.

He jerked back. The cord yanked out. The charger clattered against the sink and skidded in a wet circle. His heart went into that frantic, disorganized stutter that felt like panic but was really just his body trying to interpret a message it didn't want to hear. He grabbed the sink with his left hand and realized, a beat later, that his left hand was still tingling.

He stood very still, breathing through his nose, eyes fixed on the outlet as if it might apologize. The water around his feet stilled, glossy and innocent. The light steadied. The hum returned to its low, constant whine, as if nothing had happened.

He flexed his fingers. The sensation faded, leaving a faint soreness, like he had hit his funny bone and the joke had been bad. He felt a surge of humiliation that surprised him with its heat. He had been shocked by a bathroom outlet in a budget hostel while holding his phone like a lifeline. This wasn't the plot of a life he wanted to live. This was a meme waiting to happen.

He exhaled, a shaky laugh scraping his throat. "Static," he said to the mirror, because saying it out loud made it more real than the opposite.

He stepped out of the puddle. The cold water clung to his feet. The tingle retreated to a memory. He picked up the charger with two fingers and coiled it like it might bite again. He wiped his hand on his shirt and lifted the laptop from the sink. A bead of water rolled off the underside and splashed onto his wrist, and he flinched again, which made him angry at himself.

He pushed the door open and stepped into the hallway, where the air felt suddenly dry and normal, as if he had hallucinated the whole thing in a humid box. He leaned against the wall and closed his eyes. His breath smelled faintly of ozone. He told himself that was just the bleach.

Footsteps approached. Somchai appeared, mop in hand, moving with the slow patience of someone who had learned to clean around other people's bad choices. He looked at Marcus, then at the cord in his hand, then at the dampness on his calves. His eyes tightened, not in anger but in something worse: resignation.

"You okay?" Somchai asked.

"Yeah," Marcus said too quickly. "Just... got a little... tingle. Static. Humidity."

Somchai nodded once, the way people nod when they hear a lie they don't have the energy to correct. "Electricity no joke," he said. "Many wires old. Water everywhere. No good."

Marcus forced a smile. "I know. I was just... five percent. I needed to make a call."

Somchai shifted his mop and gestured toward the puddle. "Floor always wet. Rain, pipe, drain broken. Owner say fix later. Later never."

Marcus looked down the hall at the reception desk, where Bee sat behind her bars of acrylic and paperwork, scrolling. He wanted to tell Somchai that he understood. He wanted to say he wasn't stupid, just desperate. He said nothing. He nodded again, the nod of someone who wanted the conversation to end before it became a confession.

Somchai gave him a small, pitying look and moved on, pushing the mop through the thin sheen of water that would return the moment he left. Marcus watched him go and felt an ache under his sternum, a soft bruise of shame.

He climbed the stairs to the dorm, each step creaking like a complaint. His right hand still tingled, a faint aftertaste. He held his laptop closer to his chest, as if it could justify the last five minutes. In the dorm, the fan clicked and spun. The compass-tattoo guy had turned over, his arm dangling toward the floor. The air smelled like damp clothes and stale beer. Marcus set the laptop on his bunk and checked the phone. Six percent. The tiny victory felt ridiculous.

He should call Alan. He should call his mother. He should call someone, anyone, and say the truth aloud. He opened the phone and stared at the battery icon, as if it might contain instructions.

He called Alan.

It rang twice, then clicked to voicemail. He stared at the screen and felt the absurd relief of being spared from the conversation. The voicemail beeped. He opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again.

"Hey, Alan, it's Marcus," he said, his voice lower and less convincing than he wanted. "I got your message. I'm in transit but I'm working on it. I'll call you back tomorrow with an update." It was a lie. He told it anyway. He hung up and felt his stomach clench.

The phone dropped to five percent as if to punish him.

He opened his notes app and wrote: call mom. He stared at the words until they blurred. He did not call.

---

Morning dragged itself into the room with the sound of someone vomiting in the third-floor bathroom and the smell of toast burning downstairs. Marcus woke with his laptop open on his chest and his charger coiled like a sleeping snake on the pillow beside him. His hand had stopped tingling overnight, but the memory of it was still there, an itch in his brain.

He checked his phone. Three percent. He plugged it into the new charger and watched the brick light glow. It held. He should have felt relief. He felt suspicion. He waited for the light to flicker, for the power to cut, for the outlet to buzz. It didn't. He exhaled and decided to take the small win.

He went downstairs with the laptop under his arm, aiming for the common room window where the WiFi sometimes pretended to exist. The room was a haze of low morning voices and damp clothes. A British guy was eating dry toast straight from the bag. The ring-light girl sat cross-legged on a couch, editing footage with the intensity of someone turning chaos into content. A French couple argued over a map like it was a battlefield. The router blinked its lonely green light on the wall, a small, exhausted heartbeat.

Bee was at the desk. She looked up when he approached, her eyes tired but alert.

"You were in bathroom last night," she said. It wasn't a question.

Marcus felt his face heat. "Just for WiFi. I didn't charge."

She tilted her head. "Somchai see you. He said you get shock."

"It was just a tingle," he said, sounding defensive even to himself. "Static."

"Static doesn't burn," Bee said. She lifted her chin toward his right hand. He looked down and saw a faint red line across his palm, a thin mark where the adapter had been hot. He hadn't noticed it. He felt another flush of embarrassment.

"I'm fine," he said. "It's not a big deal."

Bee set her phone down. Her voice was even, not angry, just firm. "No charging in bathroom. We tell you many time. The wiring is bad. The water is bad. You can die."

The directness startled him. It was different than the laminated rules, different than Somchai's tired warnings. It was a flat, unornamented truth. He nodded as if he were accepting a policy update.

"Yeah," he said. "I get it."

"Do you?" she asked.

He smiled because he didn't know how else to answer. "I do. I just... needed to make a call."

Bee's eyes softened a fraction. "Everyone need to make call," she said. "Everybody wants WiFi. We have rule for reason."

He nodded again. "Right."

She picked up her phone and looked down, the conversation done. He stood there for a second, then backed away, feeling like he had just been spoken to by someone who would not tolerate another round of his rationalizations.

He moved to the window and opened his laptop. One bar. Two. None. The signal dropped. He held the laptop higher, closer to the glass, as if positioning could change physics. The cursor spun. The bar flickered. He refreshed his inbox and felt nothing when it returned empty.

He opened LinkedIn instead, because he didn't know what else to do with his hands. A post from an old classmate had gone viral: a thread about "resilience in downturns," complete with bullet points and a headshot. Marcus liked it and immediately regretted it. He could feel his own thumb betraying him.

A notification buzzed. Lina had texted again: Did you call Mom? She is worried. Please just call.

He stared at the message. He opened the call screen. The phone battery was at six percent. He imagined it dying mid-sentence, the call cutting off just as he said something he couldn't take back. He closed the call screen and typed: Will call today. He hovered over send. He didn't send. He locked the phone and shoved it into his pocket.

The toaster sparked behind him. He flinched again and pretended he was adjusting his glasses.

The day, like all the others, fell into a pattern of interruptions. Power flicker. WiFi drop. Power flicker again. Someone yelled about a shower being cold. Someone else laughed. The hostel pulsed with a low-grade chaos that everyone else seemed to accept as background. Marcus felt it as a set of obstacles to be optimized, a series of problems he couldn't solve with a spreadsheet.

He went outside for air. The heat hit him like a wet cloth. Khao San Road was alive in its loud, wet way: scooters coughing through puddles, vendors shouting, the air thick with fish sauce and exhaust. He walked past a tangle of electrical wires that sagged over the street like black veins. A drop of rain fell onto one, hissed, and disappeared. A man selling SIM cards waved at him. Marcus looked away.

He could go to the co-working space again. He knew where it was. He knew it worked. He also knew it cost four hundred baht and he had already spent too much on fake power banks and fake confidence. He did the math in his head, the way he always did when he couldn't admit to himself that the math no longer worked.

He walked back inside.

---

He took the stairs to the rooftop anyway, because the roof was the one place in the building that could pass for choice. The air up there was thick and warm, the city below a smear of neon and wet asphalt. The string of fairy lights sagged, half of them dead, half of them pulsing with the building's uneven heartbeat. Rain had paused for a moment, leaving the concrete slick and the plastic chairs upside down like turtles waiting for the next wave.

He held his phone up, arm extended, a human antenna in a city full of towers. One bar appeared and died. He stepped closer to the railing and lifted the phone higher, rainwater sliding off his knuckles. Two bars flickered, then vanished. He opened his mother's contact anyway, because the act of trying felt like movement.

It rang once. Twice. He could hear the faint line crackle, the call straining like it was pushing through humidity and bad wiring. He imagined her in her kitchen, the light on, a mug in her hand, looking at the screen and deciding whether to pick up. The line went to voicemail.

He left a message this time, because the rooftop made him feel like he could say something without the walls listening.

\"Hey, Mom. It's me. I'm... I'm okay. Bangkok is intense. I just wanted to check in. I'll call again soon.\" He hated how small it sounded. He hung up before he could correct it.

\"You look like you just pitched a ghost,\" a voice said.

He turned. Ruth, the English girl with the shaved sidecut, sat on an overturned chair with a cigarette between her fingers. She looked damp and unbothered, her poncho crumpled around her like a plastic cloak.

\"Just calling home,\" Marcus said.

\"Ah.\" She nodded toward the phone. \"Signal is shite up here. Sometimes I stand on that chair and pretend I'm a radio tower.\" She gestured at the chair beside her. \"Want a smoke?\"\n\n\"I don't smoke,\" he said, and immediately felt the need to add, \"Bad for HRV.\"\n\nRuth laughed. \"Everything here is bad for HRV. The air alone is a crime.\" She took a drag and looked out over Khao San. \"You still charging in the murder bathroom?\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" he said too quickly. \"I mean, I did last night. It was a one-off.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" she said. \"One-off keeps happening.\"\n\nHe didn't have an answer for that. He leaned on the railing and watched the street. The tangle of wires across the road sagged like black spaghetti. A tuk-tuk splashed through a puddle and a small blue spark popped at a junction. The driver didn't react. The spark vanished in the rain.\n\n\"They had a guy here a few years ago,\" Ruth said, almost casually. \"Not at this hostel, another one on Soi Rambuttri. He was charging in the shower because the WiFi was better in there. Got a zap, fell, cracked his head. Didn't die, but he was a mess. His friends got him out, and the hostel made them sign some paper.\" She flicked ash over the edge. \"People forget fast. Different hostel, same wires.\"\n\nMarcus felt the story land in him, not as fear but as irritation. There was always a story, always some cautionary tale. The world was full of people who had been unlucky. He told himself luck was not a system. He told himself he could manage the variables.\n\n\"I was fine,\" he said. \"It was a tiny tingle.\"\n\n\"Tiny tingles add up,\" Ruth said, and smiled like it was a joke. It wasn't.\n\nThe rain started again, soft at first, then harder, a heavy curtain that made the city blur. The fairy lights flickered and two went out with a faint pop. Marcus watched them die and felt a small, irrational sympathy.\n\n\"You should get a proper power bank,\" Ruth said. \"Not the street ones. Those are basically rocks.\" She took another drag and exhaled. \"Or just go to a cafe like everyone else.\"\n\nHe almost told her he couldn't afford it. He didn't. \"I'm optimizing,\" he said, because it was the only language he had left.\n\n\"Optimization doesn't matter when the input is broken,\" she said. \"That's just squeezing water out of a stone.\" She stubbed her cigarette on the wet concrete and stood. \"Anyway. Good luck with your ghost pitch.\" She gave him a small salute and disappeared down the stairs.

Marcus stood in the rain for another minute, letting it cool his skin. He looked down at the wires again, at the sagging web that carried current through the city like an old circulatory system. He could see the idea of it, the map, the flow. He could not see the fault lines. He put his phone back in his pocket and went downstairs.

---

By late afternoon, his phone had crept to twelve percent and his laptop to thirty, slow gains in a system that bled energy on contact. He sat on his bunk and tried to outline a monetization plan he could send to Matt in a month, as if a month were a meaningful unit of time. The cursor blinked at him with the patience of an executioner. He wrote three lines, deleted them, wrote two more, deleted those too.

The compass-tattoo guy asked if he wanted to join a bar crawl. Marcus said he had work. The guy shrugged and left. Marcus watched him go and felt a pang that was not jealousy so much as the recognition that the guy would probably have a better story to tell tomorrow.

He tried to charge his phone again in the dorm outlet. The adapter warmed fast. The light on the brick flickered. He unplugged it. The prongs were hot. He held them up and felt the heat on his fingers. It felt like holding a warning.

He told himself he would not go to the bathroom again. He told himself he had been scared enough the night before. He told himself he was going to walk to a cafe, buy a coffee, pay for a socket, and do things like a normal person.

At seven, the rain returned with force. It hit the roof like applause for a show that had never started. The power flickered twice. The WiFi died completely. The common room filled with bodies and noise. The air thickened with rum and sweat and the electric desperation of people trying to charge their lives in the same failing circuit.

Marcus sat on the edge of his bunk, phone at eight percent, laptop at twenty-seven. He stared at the charger cable like it was an enemy. His thoughts drifted, uninvited, to Alan's voicemail. Interest due Friday. He looked at the date on his laptop. Wednesday. Two days. He had no plan, no cash, no revenue to conjure. He had only the promise of calling back and the knowledge that he wouldn't.

He stood, because sitting was making him feel like a man waiting for a verdict. He needed to move. He needed to do something. He grabbed his laptop and charger and headed for the stairs before he could talk himself out of it.

He paused at the top of the stairs and told himself, No bathroom. He said it in his head with a firmness that would have convinced someone else.

He walked down anyway.

The common room was a blur of bodies. The router blinked like a dying star. He wove through the crowd, stepping around cups and backpacks. At the reception desk, Bee glanced up. She saw the charger in his hand and her mouth tightened. She said nothing. He said nothing. He walked past her into the hallway.

The NO CHARGING sign hung crooked on the bathroom door, its tape curling away like a surrender. Someone had added another lightning bolt beneath it, a joke that landed like a curse. He paused with his hand on the knob. He could feel the memory of the shock in his fingers. He could hear Bee's voice in his head. You can die.

He opened the door.

The air inside was heavier than outside, humid and sharp. The puddle covered the floor, a thin sheet that reached the door. The light buzzed overhead, the sound slightly higher than usual, as if the bulb was annoyed. The outlet waited in the wall, cracked, discolored, the corroded wire behind it visible like a vein.

He set the laptop on the sink. He hesitated, the charger in his hand. He could smell the faint ozone already, an electrical tang that made his nose itch. He told himself he would just check the WiFi, just send a quick message, no charging. He told himself he would be responsible, because he had been irresponsible enough.

He opened the laptop. The WiFi bars jumped to two. His inbox was empty. He opened a new message to his mother and typed, Hi Mom. He stared at the two words as if they were a cliff. He closed the message and put the phone down.

The phone battery was at six percent now. He looked at it and felt the familiar calculation begin. Six percent was not enough for a call. It was not enough for anything that mattered. He could step out and accept that, or he could plug in and make it ten. Ten was a clean number, a round number, a number that felt like a plan.

He picked up the charger.

The adapter slid into the outlet with the soft click he had started to hate. A blue flash blinked behind the plate. The light flickered. The charger glowed green. The hum returned, thin and hungry. The water around his feet felt colder than before, or maybe his feet were just numb.

He connected the phone to the laptop and watched the battery climb to seven. The number moved with a stubborn slowness that felt personal. He opened Alan's voicemail transcript and read it, the words flat and brutal. Interest due Friday. Call me back. He opened his calendar and stared at Friday like it was a cliff edge.

The tingle began in his toes, a faint fizz. He shifted his weight. It stayed. He told himself it was static, it was nothing, it was nerves. He told himself he would leave at ten percent. He told himself he was being careful now.

The light flickered harder, twice in quick succession. The charger cable trembled slightly against the wall, a subtle vibration that made his skin prickle. He glanced at the outlet and saw another tiny flash in the crack, a blue wink that left a ghost in his vision. The smell of ozone grew sharper, mixed with the faint, sweet burn of melting plastic.

He watched the battery hit eight. He waited for nine. He kept his hand on the sink, grounding himself on cold porcelain, telling himself that his body was not part of the circuit.

Nine percent.

He reached for the charger.

The light stuttered and steadied. The hum rose into a higher pitch. The water around his feet shivered as if the floor had exhaled. He froze, hand hovering over the cord, his chest tight and his breath shallow. The rain hammered the roof. The outlet sang.

He thought, absurdly, of his mother saying electricity isn't forgiving. He thought of Bee's flat warning: You can die. He thought of Alan's voicemail, Matt's polite rejection, Lina's texts. He thought of how small his world had become, condensed into battery percentages and flickering lights.

Nine percent was not ten. Ten was the plan.

He waited, watching the number creep upward, feeling the tingle climb toward his ankles like a tide.

---

He pulled the cord out at ten.

The adapter was hot, hotter than before, and he dropped it into the sink with a soft clatter that echoed in the small room. The charger light died. The hum faded. The bathroom light steadied. He stood there, breathing hard, as if he had just sprinted instead of stood in water and argued with himself.

His phone showed ten percent. He held it in his hand like a prize. The number looked both precious and pathetic.

He left the bathroom quickly, not wanting to spend another second in the air that smelled of ozone and bad decisions. The hallway felt cooler. The common room noise hit him like a wave. He moved through it in a daze, the phone in his hand, the laptop under his arm, the charger cable coiled and damp.

At the reception desk, Bee looked up. Their eyes met for a half-second. She said nothing. He said nothing. The silence between them was worse than any argument.

He took the stairs two at a time, as if distance could erase what he had just done. In the dorm, he sat on his bunk and stared at his phone. Ten percent would get him a call. It might even get him two, if he was lucky. He tapped his mother's number.

It rang once. Twice. The call dropped. The screen went black.

He sat there for a long moment, the dead phone in his hand, feeling the weight of the silence. He had gotten his ten percent and it hadn't been enough. He wanted to laugh. He didn't. He set the phone down and stared at the ceiling stain until it blurred.

The fan clicked overhead. The hallway light flickered. The rain hit the roof with the steady insistence of a metronome. He could hear the low hum in the walls, the building's old electricity breathing in the dark.

He lay back and closed his eyes. He told himself he would go to the co-working space in the morning. He told himself he would buy a real power bank. He told himself he would call his mother as soon as his phone charged. He told himself he would stop using the bathroom outlet. He told himself many things and let sleep take the edge off the lies.

Below, the ground-floor bathroom light flickered once, then steadied. The puddle spread again, thin and patient. The outlet sat in its cracked plate, humming quietly to itself, waiting for the next time someone needed one more percent.
