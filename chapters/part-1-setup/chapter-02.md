# Chapter 02: Signal in the Tiles

Marcus sent the email with his feet in a puddle, which felt like the kind of sentence people would quote later at conferences.

The bathroom was a six-by-six cube of damp that had never met a ventilation system it trusted. Humidity pressed against his skin like a hand. The fluorescent light buzzed overhead, not a steady hum but a nervous stutter, as if it was trying to make conversation. The only mirror was speckled with toothpaste and rust, and his reflection was a blur of fogged glass and bad posture.

He balanced his MacBook on the sink and typed with his wrists lifted to keep his sleeves dry, though nothing in this room was dry. The sink dripped. The shower hose drooped into the pooled water. The grout lines were blackened with mold. There was a faint, sharp smell beneath the bleach, like the air just before a summer storm.

The WiFi signal held at two bars, a miracle by hostel standards. The email drafted itself in his head while his fingers tried to keep up. He wrote about traction, about learnings, about emerging markets. He did not write about his current reality: a 28-year-old founder standing barefoot in a Bangkok bathroom, trying to charm an investor while the sink rattled under his laptop.

He hit send. The message whooshed into the void. He watched the progress wheel spin, then stop, then spin again. The little loading icon might as well have been his heart rate.

Come on, he thought. You just need one packet of data to make it out. Just one.

He checked the battery. Eleven percent. The charging light glowed an eager green. That was the thing about electricity. It worked, until it didn't.

The water touched the bottoms of his feet like a slow, cold animal. He felt a faint tickle in his heel and ignored it. The floor was wet because everything in Bangkok was wet. The hostel rule about no charging in the bathroom was a cost-saving measure, probably. There were entire nations that ran on less cautious logic. He had watched a guy in Berlin charge an electric bike in a shower stall once and lived to start a podcast about it. Risk was relative; he was a relative expert.

The email finally left his outbox. He exhaled. His shoulders dropped. For a fraction of a second, he felt something like relief, which was quickly replaced by a familiar voice in his head: what's next, what's next, what's next.

He opened LinkedIn, because the habit of performing did not take breaks. A few people had liked his last post. One had commented, a guy from Stanford who now worked at Google, "Bangkok is wild. Love this perspective." Marcus pressed the heart icon and imagined the person seeing it, imagining him seeing it, imagining him as still in control. It was a kind of prayer.

His phone buzzed. A call. The screen displayed an unknown number with a California area code. His stomach tightened. He wanted it to be Matt, the investor. He knew it wasn't.

He stared at the phone until it stopped buzzing. A voicemail appeared. He listened to it on speaker because his hands were damp and the laptop was heavy.

"Marcus? This is Alan from Lakestone. We need to circle back on the August payment. You're thirty-four days late. Again. Look, we can do a short extension, but we need to see movement. Call me back today. Please don't make me chase you." The tone was apologetic and annoyed in equal measure, like someone who had been trained to be nice to people who were currently wasting their time.

Marcus could feel the muscles in his neck tightening, not in anger but in the kind of panic that wears business casual. He looked at the laptop, at the words still open on his screen, at the send receipt that made the email feel more real. He told himself he would call back in an hour. He told himself he would never call back, because it was easier to postpone humiliation than to solve it.

The bathroom light flickered, then steadied. He imagined the building's wiring as a tired heart, struggling to beat through clogged arteries. He remembered his mother's last text: Are you okay? Call me. He had left it unread. It was easier to ignore help than to admit he needed it.

He wiped a hand on his shirt, closed the laptop, and lifted it off the sink. A drop of water slid off the underside and splashed into the puddle. The water rippled in concentric circles, like a diagram of something that wanted to matter.

He unplugged the charger. The adapter made a soft crackle as it left the outlet. He felt, for a half-second, a faint vibration in his fingertips, a tingle that was either static or his imagination. He decided it was the humidity. He decided he did not have time to think about it.

He opened the door and stepped back into the hallway, carrying the laptop like a tray. The corridor was dim and smelled of cigarette smoke and disinfectant. The sound of rain on tin was louder here. He could hear the hostel groaning, pipes clanking in the walls. The building felt alive in the wrong way.

He didn't go straight upstairs. He drifted toward the common room on autopilot, following the muffled bass like a moth. The room was a patchwork of mismatched couches and bad decisions. Two French backpackers were arguing about a bucket of neon liquor. The ring-light girl from earlier had her phone propped on a stack of books and was explaining, in a cheerful voice, how to hack monsoon season with a three-dollar poncho. Marcus watched for a moment and felt the reflexive itch to advise her on engagement strategy, on thumbnail testing, on the problem with her call-to-action. He kept his mouth shut. He had no spare bandwidth to donate to strangers who mistook performance for survival.

At the reception desk, Bee was still in the same position, scrolling with the patience of someone who had learned how to be invisible. Her sweatshirt, now visible in the flicker of the hallway light, had a coffee stain on the word ACCOUNTING. Marcus leaned on the desk bars.

"Hey," he said. "Is there any way to prioritize my device on the WiFi? Like, a better router setting?"

Bee glanced up in the way people glance at weather. "WiFi is for everyone," she said. "No special." She gestured with her chin at the little router taped to the wall, a cheap plastic box with one blinking light and a handwritten note: DO NOT RESET.

Marcus smiled, because that was his response to almost everything. "Right. But if we rebooted it off-hours, you might get a cleaner lease from the ISP. You could probably fix the bufferbloat."

Bee blinked. "You can call if you want. We do not have admin."

He wanted to explain that this was exactly the problem, that the lack of admin access was not a policy but a symptom, that he could solve this in ten minutes if he were the kind of person allowed to touch things. He didn't. He nodded, thanked her, and stepped back.

The power flickered. For half a second, the music stuttered and the room went dim, then it came back, a fraction louder, as if the speaker had taken it personally. A few people cheered. Someone shouted, "Welcome to Thailand," like it was an in-joke. Marcus felt his pulse jump. The laptop in his hands seemed heavier, the way a thing becomes heavier when you notice it can break.

He tried connecting his phone to the WiFi in the common room. Zero bars. He held it up anyway, near the ceiling, near the window, near the router. Nothing. He turned his body in a slow circle, hoping to catch a signal the way you catch a breeze. The ring-light girl glanced at him and tilted her camera to avoid him. He moved away, annoyed at being a background character in someone else's monetized life.

"Bathroom has the best signal," said a voice behind him. It was the sunburned guy with the nose ring, now holding two beers. He said it the way you say a thing you have said many times. "But the outlet in there gives you a buzz. Like, my charger tingled. Is that normal?"

"For cheap adapters," Marcus said. It came out more confident than he felt. He had an image of the spark in his head, the pop like a knuckle. "It's just a loose connection. You can work around it."

The guy nodded, then shrugged. "I don't want to die in a bathroom, you know?" He laughed, as if he'd just told a joke, and handed a beer to his friend. Marcus laughed too, because that was easier than considering the statement.

He moved toward the courtyard instead, partly to be away from the music, partly to see if the rain had eased enough to justify a rooftop attempt. The courtyard was a narrow strip of wet tile, a few plastic chairs, a crumpled ashtray. The smokers huddled under the eaves like birds that had decided they preferred nicotine to shelter. A German guy in a soaked Arsenal jersey complained about the WiFi to no one in particular. Marcus was about to offer a solution when the guy said, "I don't even need fast, I just need it to work." Marcus felt a thin, sour laugh in his throat. That's how everyone felt about him these days.

He considered going up to the roof again, but the rain had turned from drizzle to thick, falling sheets. He stood at the threshold anyway and watched the street. The neon below was smeared by water, everything bleeding into everything. The tangle of overhead wires across the road sagged under the weight of the rain. A tuk-tuk splashed past and sent a wave across the gutter. The smell of diesel and fried garlic rose up. He wanted to photograph it and caption something about emergent systems. He didn't. His phone was at five percent.

He turned back inside, the wet heat swallowing him. In the hallway, the mop bucket sat outside the bathroom like a sentry. A yellow sign leaned against it: WET FLOOR. It was unnecessary. The entire building was wet floor.

In the smoking courtyard, a group of Australian girls were taking selfies with a blow-up flamingo, which was inexplicably alive in the rain. Someone yelled something about a power outage in Room 202. A mop bucket sat abandoned outside the bathroom, water streaking down its side. The tiles glistened under the sickly light.

Marcus headed up the stairs to the dorm. Each step creaked a different note. He passed the STAFF ONLY door again and heard a low hum from behind it, a steady, electrical insect noise. He tried not to look. He tried not to think about the basement.

In Room 301, the air was thick and hot, like a mouth breathing. The fan was spinning at a lazy speed that only made the humidity move. Elise had turned her bunk into a small fort of mosquito netting and sarcasm. Her beer had been replaced by a bottle of orange soda. The Chang tank top guy was asleep, his snore a monotone.

Marcus set his laptop on his bunk and opened it to check the sent email. The WiFi bars had disappeared, replaced by a spinning wheel that might as well have been mocking him. The battery was at twelve percent now. It should have been higher. He thought about the puddle. He thought about the tingle. He told himself the charger hadn't been in long enough to matter.

He looked around for an outlet. The one by the window still sat in the wall like a loose tooth. He poked it with the tip of his finger. The plastic was warm.

"I wouldn't use that," Elise said without looking up. She was scrolling on her phone, which was connected to a tiny power bank. "It bit me last night. Like a little buzz. My hair stood up.

"Static," Marcus said, though he hadn't asked.

She lifted her eyes. "Sure. Static in a humid swamp. Right." She smiled in a way that said she didn't care if he believed her.

Marcus shrugged. He didn't need that outlet. He had already sent the email. The call was going to happen. He could handle a low battery for a few hours. He could handle most things. He sat on the edge of his bunk and opened his notes app, because his brain didn't know how to rest without pretending to work. He wrote down a list of "market gaps" he had noticed so far: unreliable WiFi, overpriced street food in tourist zones, lack of a unified hostel management platform, analog key systems, no dynamic pricing for bunk beds, an entire industry running on cash and hope. He felt like he was doing research. He felt like he was failing to exist without the fig leaf of productivity.

He glanced at the time difference and considered calling his parents. It was morning in California. His father would be at his standing desk, sipping green tea, pretending not to look at his son's LinkedIn. His mother would be in a meeting or at a fundraiser, the kind of places where people asked polite questions and pretended to care about his startup. He imagined their faces if he asked for money, a mix of worry and exhaustion. He imagined their relief if he didn't. He slid the phone back into his pocket without unlocking it.

The fan overhead clicked once, like it had hit a knot in the air. The light flickered again. He remembered his father's lecture about electrical safety, about the one time Marcus had wired a speaker wrong and tripped a breaker. His father had taken the wires from his hands and said, gently, "Electricity isn't forgiving. It doesn't care how smart you are." Marcus had laughed and told him he would build something better. He had meant it. He had built things, but not the things that kept him safe.

His phone buzzed again. The same number. This time he answered.

"Marcus," the voice said, without preamble. "Alan. How's Bangkok?"

"Alan, hey, yeah, Bangkok's great. I'm in the middle of some meetings, but I can talk for a minute."

He stood and walked toward the stairwell for privacy. The stairwell was hotter, the air stale. A cockroach skittered across a step. He stepped around it as if it were a negotiation term.

"We're not going to play games," Alan said. "You owe us eighteen thousand and eighty-two dollars. We can extend by two weeks if you pay interest, or we can send this to collections. I'm not trying to be the bad guy here, Marcus. You don't want this on your report."

Marcus pressed his forehead to the cool railing and tried to breathe in a way that didn't sound like defeat. The metal smelled like rain and rust. The hostel's light in the stairwell flickered every few seconds, like a heartbeat skipping.

"I'm working on an investor call," he said. "I'm about to close a small bridge. I just need a little more runway. Two weeks is fine. The money is coming."

He heard the other man sigh. It wasn't malicious. It was tired.

"We've been doing this for three months," Alan said. "Look, I like you. I really do. But the board doesn't care about your story. They care about numbers. You don't have income. You don't have assets. You have debt and a... and a laptop."

Marcus glanced at the laptop on his bunk, as if it might overhear and be offended.

"It's not just a laptop," he said, hearing how ridiculous it sounded. "The IP is solid. The network is solid. I'm in the field."

"You are in a hostel," Alan said, and there was no insult in it, just fact. "I'll extend you two weeks. Pay the interest by Friday. After that, I'm out of options."

Marcus felt a heat rise behind his eyes. He swallowed it. He was good at swallowing things.

"Okay," he said. "Friday."

"I wish you luck," Alan said, and the call ended.

Marcus stayed in the stairwell for a minute longer, listening to the sound of rain and the faint, consistent hum of the building's electrical heart. He felt, very suddenly, like a child who had wandered too far from the noise of the party. The shame was physical. It sat in his chest like a weight.

He wanted to call his mother. He wanted to ask for help. He wanted to go home. He wanted to pretend none of this was happening. He picked the last option, because it was the only one that did not require him to be different.

He returned to the dorm, slid onto his bunk, and stared at his laptop. The screen had gone dark. The battery was at nine percent. The WiFi icon was empty.

He opened the notes app and wrote a line he could believe: "Momentum is fragile but scalable." He closed the laptop and set it beside him. His Whoop band buzzed with a notification: HIGH STRESS. He turned it off.

Down in the common room, music started to thump. The party crowd was beginning to move. He could hear laughter and the clink of bottles, the low, rising roar of a night that was about to either begin or end. He had no energy for either.

He lay back on his pillow and stared at the metal slats above him. The ceiling was stained in the corner, a pale brown water mark shaped like a country he did not recognize. The humidity pressed down on him like a heavy blanket. He could smell his own sweat, the hotel's lemongrass disinfectant, the faint mildew that lived in the walls.

His phone buzzed again. This time it was a notification: his email to Matt had been opened. A single checkmark. He sat up, adrenaline rushing. He opened the email. There was no reply.

He refreshed. He refreshed again. The spinning wheel mocked him.

He had one bar of WiFi, then none. He held his phone at different angles, a human antenna. He climbed down and walked to the window. Outside, the rain had thickened. The street was a river. He could see umbrellas bobbing like mushrooms. The neon signs reflected in the water, making the world look like a broken circuit board.

He checked his battery again. Seven percent.

He looked at the charger coiled on his bunk. He looked at the outlet by the window. He looked at the hallway, the stairs, the memory of two steady bars in the bathroom.

He tried the outlet anyway. The plug slid in too easily, which felt wrong. The charger light did not turn on. He jiggled the plug. A faint crackling noise came from inside the wall, like tiny fireworks. The light blinked once, then went dead. He pulled the adapter out. The metal prongs were warm.

"Told you," Elise said, not unkindly.

Marcus tucked the charger into his bag, as if hiding it would fix anything. He stood, laptop under his arm, phone in his hand. He wanted to call Matt. He wanted to send a follow-up. He wanted to be anywhere with a signal.

He walked down the stairs with his shoulders tight and his jaw locked. At the bottom, the hostel was louder. The common room had filled with bodies. Someone had dragged a speaker onto the coffee table. The music was a dance track with a beat like an anxious heart. People were pouring cheap whiskey into plastic cups and taking selfies. A British guy was doing a shirtless handstand against the wall while a girl laughed. The air smelled like sweat and alcohol and wet shoes.

Marcus pushed through the crowd, his laptop held above the cups. He glanced at the reception desk. Bee was there, looking bored, her eyes on her phone. She glanced up as he passed, then looked away. He could almost hear her thinking: not my problem.

He walked to the bathroom door and paused. The NO CHARGING sign sat at eye level, the marker letters thick and tired. The tape had peeled at one corner. He touched the sign with two fingers and peeled it back a fraction, as if checking to see if the rule was real. The paper was warm from the humidity. He pressed it back down.

Someone banged on the opposite bathroom door upstairs, yelling that the shower was cold. A burst of laughter came from the common room. The music got louder. The monsoon pounded on the tin awning with the persistence of a drum line.

Marcus opened the bathroom door and slipped inside. The sound dropped away. The small room was a pocket of humid quiet. The fluorescent light buzzed its tired song. The puddle was still there, a little wider now. The drain gurgled like it was chewing something it didn't want.

He set his laptop on the sink again. The surface was damp, so he lifted it with one hand while plugging in the charger with the other. The adapter slid into the outlet with a soft click. There was a tiny blue flash, like a camera in miniature, and a pop that he felt in his teeth. He froze for a second. The charging light came on. The laptop hummed.

He let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. He told himself that sparks were normal with cheap adapters. He told himself that the sign was old, that the staff were overreacting, that he had control over this situation because he had not slept in a hostel before and therefore could see it clearly. He told himself a lot of things. The puddle was cool against his toes.

The WiFi connected. Two bars. He opened the email and typed a follow-up to Matt.

"Just sent the deck through. Would love 15 minutes to walk you through the metrics. I'm free in the next hour."

He hit send. The spinning wheel appeared again. He watched it, hypnotized. His phone buzzed with low battery. He ignored it. He stood in the puddle and waited for a connection that felt like it should exist because he needed it.

The light above him flickered once. The faint smell of ozone thickened, as if the air were remembering a storm. He could hear the music outside, muffled now. He could hear the rain. He could hear, if he focused, the thin high buzz inside the outlet, the sound of electricity moving through a gap it should not be moving through.

Marcus looked at the sign again. NO CHARGING. The letters looked smug. He stared at them and felt an old rage, the one that came up whenever a rule tried to slow him down. He was not a child. He had built companies. He had scaled teams. He had hacked systems. He could certainly manage a laptop in a bathroom.

He shifted his weight, trying to get comfortable, and his left foot slid deeper into the puddle. The water was cool and slick and bigger than before. He felt the faintest tingling in his arch, a whisper of pins and needles. He shifted again, and it went away.

His email sent. A checkmark appeared. His chest loosened. The dread had not gone; it had simply moved to a different queue.

He closed the laptop, disconnected the charger, and lifted it off the sink. A drop of water slid down the cable and onto his wrist. He wiped it with his sleeve and opened the door. The noise rushed in, the music and laughter and the building's wheeze. He stepped back into the hallway with his laptop in his arms like something small and precious.

Behind him, the bathroom light flickered again, then steadied. The puddle remained, a shallow mirror reflecting the fluorescent buzz. The sign sagged on its tape. The outlet sat in the wall, silent now, waiting.

Marcus walked toward the stairs, thinking about the investor, about Alan, about his mother, about his battery percentage. He told himself he would sleep after one more email, after one more line of code, after one more miracle.

The monsoon rain intensified, and somewhere in the building a fuse hummed in warning.
