# Chapter 06: Thirty-Five Percent

Thirty-five percent is not a real number. It is the kind of number you make up to feel less afraid of the dark.

Marcus stood barefoot in the wet bathroom, watching the battery icon climb toward that invented line. Thirty-three. Thirty-four. The charger hummed. The fluorescent light above him flickered as if it had a pulse. The puddle spread in slow, patient increments, a quiet animal growing around his feet. He told himself he would leave at thirty-five. He told himself he would never do this again. He told himself a lot of things because the alternative was admitting that he had run out of choices and was now negotiating with a wall outlet.

The light flickered harder, a short sputter. The hum in the outlet became a higher whine. He felt the hair on his arms lift, a faint tingling along his wrists. He looked down, as if the water might explain itself. It didn't. It just sat there, thin and glossy, catching the harsh light and reflecting it back at him.

Thirty-five.

He reached for the charger and the outlet crackled like a dry leaf. A small blue spark blinked behind the plate. He froze, fingers hovering an inch away, a ridiculous stillness in his body. The spark was gone. The charger light remained green, the laptop still charging as if nothing had happened.

He unplugged it quickly anyway. He told himself he had been smart. He told himself he had listened to the sign in his own way, by not pushing his luck. He ignored the way his heart was beating fast, the way his palms felt slick even in the humidity.

He shut the laptop and clutched it under his arm. He stepped toward the door, his feet making soft splashes in the puddle. The water clung to his skin, a cold film that didn't feel like water so much as a warning. He paused, hesitated, and then left, not because he felt safe but because he couldn't stand the sound of the outlet humming anymore.

The hallway air felt drier, almost cool, and the shift made the damp on his legs feel heavy. He walked past the reception desk. Bee was there, head down, fingers moving on her phone. He didn't meet her eyes. He didn't want to see an I-told-you in her face, even if it would have been deserved.

He climbed the stairs with the laptop tucked under his arm like a fragile animal. The teak steps creaked beneath him, each one its own small complaint. The dorm was quiet, the party energy downstairs spent and dispersed. The fan above his bunk ticked in a tired rhythm. He set the laptop down and wiped the water off his feet with a towel that never quite dried. He looked at the charger cable, still warm in his hand, and thought about the smell of pennies. He put it away.

Sleep came in broken slices. The power flickered twice in the night, each time pulling him to the surface of consciousness as if the building was tugging on his sleeve. He dreamed of battery icons and graphs that never went up, of wires wrapped around his wrists like watch bands. He woke to the taste of metal in his mouth, unsure if it was the dream or the humidity or the slight bite he had taken out of his tongue in the night.

Morning was a damp knot of light and noise. The hostel woke up in its usual staggered rhythm: toilets flushing, shower water pounding tile, a cough in the hallway, a soft thud as someone dropped a backpack. The fluorescent lights buzzed and sputtered, the same nervous stutter Marcus had come to recognize as the building's version of a heartbeat.

His phone was at four percent. His laptop was at forty, which felt like a miracle and also like a joke. The charger cable had a faint brown smear near the adapter, a tiny scorch mark that looked like a fingerprint left by a ghost. He held it close to his face and decided it was dirt.

He should have gone back to the co-working space. He should have spent another four hundred baht for air conditioning, stable WiFi, and a chair that didn't feel like a prank. He should have done a lot of things. Instead, he opened his laptop at the edge of his bunk and tried the hostel WiFi, because he was an optimist, or because he had already spent his optimism yesterday.

One bar. Two bars. None. The signal faded in and out like it was embarrassed to be seen with him. He refreshed his inbox anyway, because refreshing was easier than accepting silence.

There was nothing from Matt. There was nothing from Alan. There was a thumbs-up from Lina and a follow-up text: Call Mom today. Please.

He stared at the message until the words went soft. He wanted to call. He wanted to say something that would make his mother proud, or at least not worried. He wanted to have a plan. He had the outline of one, the bones of a strategy he could build on if he could just stay online. He typed a reply to Lina: Working on it. Call later. He did not send it.

He sat back and looked around the dorm. The new guy with the compass tattoo was still asleep, his arm draped over his face. Someone else was rummaging through a locker, zippers rasping like paper tearing. The air smelled like wet socks and lemongrass disinfectant. The fan overhead clicked on a slow, uneven cycle, pushing the humidity around rather than away.

He climbed down the ladder and went to the common room with his laptop in his arms. The kitchen smelled of toast and cheap coffee. The toaster sparked when someone pressed it down, a quick flash that made him flinch and pretend he hadn't. He poured a glass of water from the dispenser and watched algae float near the plastic spigot. He drank anyway.

Bee was behind the desk, a cup of instant coffee in her hand. She looked up and offered him a small, tired smile. It wasn't warmth. It was the acknowledgement of someone who had seen him pace the hallways all week and had decided he wasn't the worst type of tourist.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning." She nodded toward the laptop. "WiFi not good today. Maybe later. Rain." She said the last word as if it were a person.

"Yeah." He hesitated, then asked, "Is the owner around? I wanted to ask about the router, maybe a better plan. I can set something up. It's really not expensive." He tried to sound helpful, not desperate.

Bee looked toward the back, toward the STAFF ONLY door, then back at him. "Owner sleep. Owner not like change. We tell him already. He say after high season." She lifted a shoulder and let it fall.

He almost laughed. High season. He was here in the middle of monsoon, and still somehow it was high season. There was always a season for delay.

He thanked her and stepped away, laptop under his arm, moving toward the window where the light was better and sometimes the WiFi felt like it wanted to work. It didn't.

He opened his phone, scrolled through his feed, and found himself staring at a tweet from an account called @HostelReaper. The profile image was a cartoon skull wearing a bucket hat. The tweet said, "Budget travel tip: if your charger tingles, that's the universe telling you to stop charging." It had 12,000 likes and a reply thread full of jokes and horror stories. He stared at it for too long, then scrolled past quickly, as if the algorithm could see his guilt.

He told himself it was a coincidence. He told himself it was just a meme. He told himself he didn't believe in signs.

The rain hit the awning harder, a sudden drumline. The lights flickered. A few backpackers in the common room cheered when the power stayed on, as if that counted as a win. Marcus watched the router blink its lonely green eye and felt his patience thinning.

He walked back upstairs, because the dorm at least had an outlet he could try. He plugged the charger into the wall by his bunk. The adapter slid in too easily. The charger light flickered, then steadied. The outlet made a soft buzzing sound, faint but constant. He told himself it was normal.

He left the charger in place and tucked his phone into his pocket. He felt the buzzing through the wall even when he wasn't touching it, a vibration more in his bones than in the air. It made him think of a dentist's drill. It made him think of nerves.

The buzz stopped when the power flickered ten minutes later. The charger light blinked out and came back on in a stutter. He pulled the adapter out and the metal prongs were warm. He held them to his cheek for a second, which felt both ridiculous and necessary. Warm. Not hot. He put it away.

He could feel the day slipping toward the same loop: seek signal, find warning, ignore it, repeat. He told himself he needed a break, a shower, a little normalcy. He grabbed a towel and headed to the third-floor bathroom, the one with more showers and less doom.

The floor up there was damp too, but less so. The showers were hot for five minutes, then cold. The water ran over his shoulders and he felt the grime of the last day loosen. He closed his eyes and let the cold shock him into something like wakefulness.

In the shower, his thoughts came in clean, harsh lines. He needed to call his mother. He needed to be honest with someone. He needed money, or a miracle, or a pivot that didn't feel like a lie. He needed to stop standing in bathrooms with his laptop like a man who thought physics was optional. He laughed once, a short, humorless sound. The water ran cold and stayed cold.

He dried off and dressed in fresh merino, the soft fabric a small luxury. He checked his phone. Three percent. He went back to the bunk, plugged in again, waited for the charger light to come on. It didn't. He wiggled the adapter. A soft crackle came from inside the wall. The light blinked, then died. He stared at it for a long second, then yanked it out.

He could have gone to the co-working space. He could have walked to a cafe. He could have taken the day off. He opened his laptop and carried it downstairs instead.

In the late afternoon, the hostel filled with the second wave of arrivals, backpacks and sunburns and the smell of wet nylon. The common room was a low thrum of voices and clinking bottles. The rain had eased to a humid drip, leaving the street steamed and glossy.

Marcus sat on the edge of a couch with his laptop on his knees, trying to coax a bar of signal out of the air. The router blinked. The WiFi wavered. The cursor turned into a spinning wheel and stayed that way. He watched the circle and felt an almost violent urge to press his thumb against the screen until it stopped.

A guy with a shaved head and a half-done tattoo sat beside him and asked if he knew any good clubs. Marcus shook his head. The guy shrugged and kept scrolling. Everyone in this room was chasing something. Everyone was trying to charge their small pieces of life in the same failing circuit.

He closed the laptop and opened his phone to check the battery. Two percent. His chest tightened, a small, familiar panic. He reached into his bag and pulled out the cheap power bank he had bought yesterday. He pressed the button. The light flickered once and died. He pressed it again. Nothing. He shook it, like it was a remote or a dead mouse. Still nothing.

He laughed under his breath, a sound with no humor in it. He imagined a marketing tagline: NomadSync, now powered by false hope and counterfeit batteries.

He stood and walked toward the bathroom. He told himself he was just going to use the WiFi. He told himself he wasn't going to charge anything. He told himself he didn't need to believe those words for them to matter.

The hallway to the ground-floor bathroom was wetter than usual. Somchai had mopped, but the puddle kept coming back, a recurring flood that refused to be corrected. The NO CHARGING sign hung at its usual angle, the tape peeling. Someone had added a small smiley face in pen under the word NO, as if humor could make it safer.

He pushed the door open.

The bathroom was still small, still humid, still full of the faint, metallic smell that made him think of pennies and storms. The fluorescent light buzzed and stuttered, casting a pale green sheen over the tile. The puddle was wider now, a sheet of water that covered nearly the entire floor. It gleamed like oil.

He stepped inside, barefoot. The water was cool and immediate, wrapping around his feet. He reached up to the sink and set his laptop down. The surface was wet, so he lifted it with one hand while he uncoiled the charger with the other. He hesitated, the adapter in his hand, the memory of the spark flashing in his head.

He could hear Bee's voice. Not safe. He could hear his father's voice. Electricity isn't forgiving. He could hear Matt's voice. Can't commit. He could hear his own voice, the one that always said just a little longer.

He plugged the adapter into the outlet.

A tiny blue flash blinked behind the cracked plate. The light flickered, then steadied. The charger light glowed green. The outlet hummed, a thin, constant note that made his teeth itch.

He told himself it was fine.

He connected his phone to the laptop and watched the battery icon climb from two to three. He felt a ridiculous relief at the sight of it. He opened his email and refreshed. Still nothing. He opened Lina's message and stared at it again. He typed, Call soon. He didn't send it.

The water around his feet warmed, or maybe his feet warmed it. He felt a faint tingling in his arches, the same whisper as last night. He shifted his weight and it moved up his ankles like a tide.

The light buzzed. The outlet hummed. The charger cable trembled slightly against the wall, the way a string does when it is pulled too tight. He stared at the battery icon until it hit five. He told himself he would leave at ten. He told himself he was being safe now, that this was just a quick top-up.

The door opened behind him.

Marcus startled, his shoulders jerking. Somchai stood in the doorway, mop in hand, his eyes taking in the scene in a quick sweep. He said something in Thai, a short phrase that sounded like an instruction. Marcus didn't understand, but he understood the tone.

"I just need a minute," Marcus said. He kept his voice light. "WiFi is better in here. I'll be out soon."

Somchai looked at the outlet, then at the puddle, then at Marcus. His eyes were tired, and behind them was something else, a flicker of annoyance or fear. "No charge," he said, his English careful. "Danger."

"I'm being careful," Marcus said, and hated himself for how much he sounded like a teenager.

Somchai shook his head slowly. "Many wires. Old. Wet." He gestured toward the floor. "Not good."

Marcus wanted to explain, to say he had a grounded adapter, to say he knew about surge protection, to say he wasn't an idiot. He said none of those things. He nodded. "Two minutes."

Somchai sighed and moved past him, pushing the mop into the puddle. The mop head soaked up water, then pushed it around in slow loops, as if he could herd the puddle into submission. The water moved, then settled back into place the moment the mop lifted. The drain gurgled and refused.

"Problem all the time," Somchai said, more to himself than to Marcus. "Owner say fix later. Later never come."

Marcus felt a small, sharp embarrassment. He looked at the charger cable, the outlet, the puddle. The humor drained out of the situation and left the physics behind.

He unplugged the charger. The adapter crackled as it left the outlet. Somchai glanced up, nodded once, and kept mopping. Marcus lifted his laptop, water dripping from the underside. He stepped toward the door and felt the tingle in his feet fade as the water thinned near the threshold.

"Sorry," he said, because it was easier than anything else.

Somchai did not answer. He pushed the mop back and forth, cleaning a flood that would return before the mop dried.

Marcus closed the door behind him. The hallway air felt lighter. He leaned against the wall and exhaled. His phone battery was at seven percent. He told himself it would be enough to call his mother. He took the phone out, hesitated, and put it back.

By night, the hostel had settled into its usual pre-party hum. The common room smelled like sweat, cheap rum, and damp clothes. Someone turned the TV up, though no one watched it. The router blinked. The lights flickered. The rain came and went in sharp, impatient bursts.

Marcus sat on his bunk with the laptop open, pretending to work. His phone battery ticked down as he checked email, checked LinkedIn, checked anything that might show a sign of traction in a life that felt like it was losing signal. He refreshed his inbox twice in a minute. Nothing.

He opened a blank note and began to write a list of possible pivots. Hostel WiFi management. Digital nomad finance tools. Remote work insurance. He wrote each idea down and watched it look absurd on the screen, like the kind of list you make at two in the morning when you can't sleep and your brain wants to believe it still has options. He deleted the list and closed the laptop.

He lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling stain. It looked darker now, the edges spreading. He thought about water again, about the way it always found the lowest point, the way it gathered and waited. He thought about his own habit of pooling in the wrong places: inboxes he didn't answer, calls he didn't return, bathrooms he shouldn't charge in.

His phone buzzed. A low battery warning. He checked it. Four percent. The screen dimmed as if the device had decided to conserve itself. He could hear the common room music, the laughter, the clink of bottles. He could hear the rain. He could hear the low hum in the walls.

He could also hear his sister's voice in his head: Call Mom today. Please.

He opened his contacts and hovered over his mother's name. He wanted to call. He wanted to hear her voice, to be told that it would be okay even if he couldn't believe it. He imagined the conversation, the pauses, the careful questions. He imagined saying, I'm in a hostel and it's not going well, and hearing the silence on the other end as she tried to decide whether to worry or to scold. He imagined all of it and then closed the phone.

The battery dropped to three percent.

He stood and grabbed his charger. He stood still for a long time, looking at the cord in his hand like it was a snake. He could go to the common room and plug into the outlet by the fridge, wait his turn behind a line of phones. He could go outside to a cafe and pay for a socket with a coffee. He could go to the bathroom and be done in ten minutes.

He walked to the bathroom.

The hallway tile was slick. The NO CHARGING sign hung like a taunt. He pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The puddle was there, of course. It always was. It had spread almost to the door now, a thin sheen of water that reflected the fluorescent light like a cheap mirror. The air smelled of bleach and mildew and something sharper, a metal tang that seemed to thicken as soon as he entered.

He set his laptop on the sink and plugged in the charger. The adapter flashed blue. The light flickered. The charger glowed green. The outlet hummed. He stepped into the water and felt the coolness rise around his feet, a small shock to his system that made him feel awake.

He opened his laptop. Two bars of WiFi. He opened his email and stared at the empty inbox. He opened a new message to his mother, fingers hovering above the keys. He typed, Hi Mom. He stopped. He backspaced. He typed, Just checking in. He stopped again.

He could hear the party downstairs. He could hear the rain. He could hear the outlet humming back at him. He could feel the faint tingle in his feet, a soft, insistent prickling like the moment before a limb falls asleep. He shifted his weight. The tingle stayed.

He looked at the outlet plate, the crack in it, the dark line of corroded wire behind. He imagined the current running through that line, invisible and indifferent. He imagined his own body as a conductor, a wet bridge. He swallowed, his mouth suddenly dry.

He told himself to leave. He told himself he would, after the battery hit ten. He watched the battery climb to six, then seven, then eight. Each number felt like a small anchor, a reason to stay.

The light flickered harder. The hum in the outlet rose, a high, thin sound like a mosquito you couldn't swat. The tingle in his feet moved up his calves, a faint fizz under the skin. He lifted his left foot and set it down again, testing the sensation. The tingle stayed.

His phone buzzed in his pocket and died. The screen went black. He pulled it out anyway, tapped it, and got nothing. He put it back. He felt, absurdly, that the darkness of the screen had spread to his own insides.

He unplugged the phone and watched the laptop battery climb to eleven. He told himself that was enough. He told himself he could go upstairs, call his mother tomorrow, figure out his life after a night of sleep. He told himself it was fine.

He reached for the charger.

The outlet crackled, louder than before. A blue flash blinked in the crack of the plate. The light above him stuttered twice. The hum rose into a whine. For a half-second, the sensation in his feet sharpened, and the tingle felt less like pins and more like a warning bite.

He froze, hand on the cord. His chest tightened. He felt his heart jump, a sudden, involuntary spike. He pulled the charger out in a quick, clumsy motion. The adapter felt hot in his hand, not warm this time but hot, a small burn against his palm. He dropped it onto the sink with a soft clatter.

He stood there, breathing hard, listening to the hum fade. The light steadied. The puddle around his feet was still, as if nothing had happened. He lifted his feet and stepped toward the door, leaving wet footprints that vanished behind him.

He paused in the doorway and looked back. The outlet sat in the wall, quiet now, its crack dark. The NO CHARGING sign hung beneath it, a tired paper plea. He closed the door and leaned against the hallway wall, sweat cooling on his back.

He told himself he had learned something. He told himself he would not do this again. He told himself he would buy a real power bank tomorrow, that he would go to a cafe, that he would call his mother, that he would stop treating the bathroom like a co-working space. He told himself those things because telling himself was easy.

The rain started again, harder. The lights flickered. Somewhere downstairs, someone laughed. The hostel hummed and breathed, its old wiring alive in the walls.

Marcus walked upstairs, the laptop warm under his arm, the charger cable coiled and hot in his hand, the wet sensation still lingering around his ankles like a memory.

He lay down on his bunk and stared at the ceiling. The stain looked like it had grown again. He closed his eyes and listened to the building, to the rain, to the hum in the walls.

In the dark, the outlet in the ground-floor bathroom waited, the puddle gathering again as if it had all the time in the world.
