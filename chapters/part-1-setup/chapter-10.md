# Chapter 10: Failover

Seven percent is the kind of number that makes you believe in miracles right up until the miracle drops the call.

Marcus stood in the ground-floor bathroom, ankle-deep in lukewarm water, watching the battery on his phone inch from six to seven like a tiny elevator that did not want to reach his floor. The outlet hummed in the wall, a thin note that had started to feel like a conversation. The light buzzed overhead in a stuttering rhythm that matched his pulse. The puddle reflected his legs and the underside of the sink in a shimmering, distorted mirror. It looked like he was standing in a ghost version of himself.

Seven percent.

He reached for the cord and pulled it out in one quick motion, as if speed counted as safety. The adapter came free with a soft crackle. The charger light died. The hum dropped to a lower, dissatisfied tone. For a second his hand tingled, a faint aftershock that he pretended not to notice. He dropped the adapter into the sink and watched it bounce once, a small plastic ribcage clacking against porcelain.

He lifted the phone to his ear and tapped his mother’s name. The call rang once, twice, then clicked into voicemail. He closed his eyes and started to speak anyway, because he had already come this far and the failure of a phone call felt less humiliating than the failure of a life.

“Hey, Mom,” he said, a little too cheerful, a little too fast. “It’s me. I’m... I’m okay. Sorry I missed you. I’ll call again soon. Love you.”

He hung up and stared at the screen as the battery ticked down to six. It felt like being charged interest on honesty.

He set the phone on the sink, picked up the laptop, and backed toward the door. The water clung to his ankles as he stepped out, leaving wet footprints that vanished behind him. In the hallway, the air felt cooler, drier, and less accusatory. He took a breath and tasted the faint metallic tang of ozone on his tongue. He told himself it was the bleach. He told himself the tingling in his hand was just nerves. He told himself he would not do that again.

As he passed the reception desk, Bee looked up from her phone. Her eyes flicked to the damp cuffs of his pants, then to the charger cable coiled in his hand. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t need to. The silence between them was a warning that had learned to wear a human face.

He climbed the stairs to the dorm and set the laptop on his bunk. The room smelled like wet clothes and old deodorant. The fan clicked overhead, fighting a losing battle against the humidity. The compass-tattoo guy was snoring softly, a steady saw cutting through the heat. Marcus checked his phone again. Six percent. He opened his messages. Lina had sent another: Just call her when you can. She’s worried.

He typed back, I just tried. Call dropped. Will call again later. He watched the words, then hit send because he wanted to believe he had done something.

He sat on the edge of the bunk and stared at the charger cable. The adapter looked slightly smudged near the tip, a faint brown streak that might have been dirt or might have been heat. He rubbed it with his thumb and told himself it was grime. He couldn’t afford to think it was anything else.

By midmorning, the rain had turned the hostel into a living sponge. The air pressed against him with wet heat, and the building’s electrical hum ran through the walls like an old song you couldn’t stop hearing. Marcus tried to work from the common room, laptop on his knees, phone balanced beside it like a small, dying bird. The WiFi flickered on and off, a heartbeat with arrhythmia. He refreshed his inbox four times in ten minutes. Nothing.

He opened LinkedIn instead, because scrolling felt like progress. A former classmate had posted a thread about “embracing constraints” and had tagged it with a photo of a sunrise over a rooftop pool. Marcus felt the familiar itch to comment, to correct, to say that constraints were not a lifestyle choice. He kept his hands to himself.

The toaster sparked when someone pushed it down. Marcus flinched and then pretended to scratch his neck.

“Power’s weird today,” a British girl said to no one in particular, holding a phone cable that had started to curl like a burnt wick. “My charger keeps biting me.”

“Static,” Marcus said, reflexively. It came out sharper than he intended. The girl blinked at him, then shrugged, unconvinced. He felt his face warm.

He took his laptop to the reception desk. Bee was there, half watching a drama on her phone. He leaned in. “Is there a coworking space nearby that’s cheap? Like, cheaper than the one on Samsen?”

Bee looked up, thought for a second. “There is cafe on Chakrabongse. Good WiFi. You buy coffee, you sit.”

“How much for coffee?”

She made a small circle with her fingers. “Sixty, seventy. Not too much.”

Marcus did the math. Seventy baht was a tenth of a night’s stay. It felt like a bargain. It also felt like admitting defeat.

“Okay,” he said. “Thanks.”

He turned to go and Bee said, without looking up, “No charging in bathroom.”

He stopped. “I know,” he said.

Bee finally lifted her eyes to him, and there was a tired firmness there, a woman who had seen enough to know when to stop negotiating. “No charging,” she repeated. “Water, old wire. You already get shock. Don’t go again.”

Her directness hit him like a slap. He nodded as if he were receiving a policy update, as if he were a reasonable adult who hadn’t spent three nights bargaining with an outlet. “Got it,” he said, and meant it in the way people mean gym memberships in January.

He walked out into the wet heat, down Khao San Road, toward Chakrabongse. The street was a smear of neon and puddles. Vendors yelled over each other, scooters wove between pedestrians, and a monk passed through the crowd like a quiet message no one had time to read. Overhead, a tangle of black wires sagged between poles, dripping rainwater in slow, deliberate drops. Marcus watched a droplet hit a junction and hiss into steam. The vendor beside him didn’t even look up.

The cafe was small, narrow, and blessedly air-conditioned. Marcus paid for a coffee and took a seat near a cracked window. The WiFi was fast. His email sent on the first try. He sat back and felt the strange relief of a system that actually worked. It was so rare it felt decadent.

He opened his bank app. The numbers had shrunk again, as if they were contracting with the humidity. He closed it and opened a new document, titled REVENUE PLAN. He stared at the blank page and tried to imagine a world in which it contained an answer. He typed a sentence about subscription tiers and deleted it. He typed another about corporate partnerships and deleted that too. He could feel the words refusing to sit still.

He opened a draft email to Alan. He wrote: I’m working on a bridge. He stared at it and deleted it. He wrote: I can make an interest payment by Friday if you can extend. He deleted it. He wrote: I need help. He deleted that too.

He took a sip of coffee. It tasted like burnt sugar and bitter hope. He checked his phone. Nine percent. He could call his mother. He could. He didn’t. He told himself he would do it after he had something good to say. He told himself he would call from the hostel when the battery was higher. He told himself he was waiting for the right moment. He told himself a lot of things.

The monsoon came hard at noon, slamming the street with a sudden roar. The cafe windows shuddered. The lights flickered once and steadied. Marcus flinched anyway.

He left an hour later with a slightly higher battery and a slightly lower bank balance. The walk back to the hostel felt heavier, the air thicker. He passed a stall selling chargers and power banks, a display of plastic promises. He didn’t stop.

On the second floor, he cut through the hallway toward the shared bathroom, telling himself he needed a shower, that he needed to rinse the ozone and the shame off his skin. The hallway light flickered, then steadied. The door to the bathroom was open. Steam rolled out, thick and sour.

Inside, a German backpacker was leaning over the sink, rubbing the hair on his forearm. “The shower bit me,” he said to no one. “Not like pain, just... like a buzz.” He laughed, then shook his head. “Man, Thailand is wild.”

Marcus nodded like this was normal, like he hadn’t just been bargaining with a ground-floor outlet for battery percentages. “Static,” he said again, because it was the only word he had for it.

He stepped into a shower stall and turned the knob. The water ran hot for thirty seconds, then turned cold, a sudden slap that made him gasp. He stood under it anyway, because the cold felt like a punishment he deserved. The metal faucet buzzed faintly when he touched it, a soft vibration that could have been water pressure or something else. He lifted his hand away and told himself it was just the building settling, just pipes, just his nerves.

He washed quickly, dried off with a towel that smelled like bleach and old fabric, and got dressed. As he left, he caught sight of a burn mark above one of the outlets, a small black halo around the plastic. It was the kind of detail he would have noticed on day one and filed away as evidence of mismanagement. Now he just looked at it and kept walking.

Back in the dorm, he opened his laptop and drafted a short post for LinkedIn. “Day 4 in Bangkok. Infrastructure gaps = opportunity. Remote work in SEA has massive upside if we can standardize access.” He stared at the sentence, felt it ring hollow, then posted it anyway. The likes came in slow, a few polite hearts from people who still believed he knew what he was talking about. He refreshed the page too many times and watched the number crawl up like the battery icons he had started to worship.

On the way downstairs, he checked his Twitter feed and found another @HostelReaper post in his timeline, a photo of a frayed charging cable on a wet tile floor with the caption: “If your charger is swimming, your battery is not the problem.” It had been retweeted by someone he followed, a travel influencer he had once pitched a partnership to. He closed the app and told himself it was just internet noise. He told himself it was not about him.

---

The afternoon stretched into the kind of slow, humid blur that made time feel viscous. Marcus sat on his bunk, laptop open, trying to work on the revenue plan. The cursor blinked at him like a metronome of failure. He wrote a bullet list of “potential monetization opportunities” and then stared at it until the words felt like a parody.

1) Partnerships with hostels (ironic)
2) Premium listings for coworking spaces
3) Commission on tours
4) Crypto staking rewards (just kidding)

He deleted the list and closed the laptop. The battery was at twenty-eight percent. The phone was at eleven. He felt no closer to a plan.

At four, the power flickered twice in quick succession and the fan above him stuttered. A low murmur rolled through the dorm. The compass-tattoo guy swore and thumped his pillow. Marcus watched the charger light blink and steadied it with a hand that felt suddenly superstitious. He pulled the adapter out before it could get hot, because he had started to think of heat as an omen.

He went downstairs to the common room. The WiFi was dead again. The router blinked its tired green eye. Someone had plugged a power strip into another power strip and then into another, building a small tower of desperation that made the lights flicker harder. Bee opened her mouth to say something, then closed it and looked away.

Marcus wandered into the hallway and stood outside the ground-floor bathroom, not because he wanted to go in, but because he needed to know that he wouldn’t. The NO CHARGING sign hung crooked. Someone had reinforced the tape with a new strip, bright and fresh. It looked like the warning had been re-armed.

He turned away.

He went outside to the courtyard and leaned against the damp wall. Somchai was there, pushing his mop in slow, resigned arcs. The puddle at the bathroom door re-formed as fast as he could push it away. The water was winning the argument, as it always did.

“You okay?” Somchai asked, not looking up.

“Yeah,” Marcus said. He didn’t add: I’m not.

Somchai nodded and kept mopping. “Rain is bad this week,” he said. “Wire is old. Owner say fix later. Later always.”

Marcus glanced toward the STAFF ONLY door, where a low hum pulsed behind the wall. “Is it... worse than usual?” he asked.

Somchai hesitated. “Maybe. This year more rain.” He wrung out the mop, water splashing into the bucket with a dull slap. “Bathroom floor not drain. Always wet.”

Marcus pictured the puddle, the cracked outlet plate, the thin line of corroded wire behind it. He pictured his own reflection in the water, distorted. He felt the memory of the shock in his hand and tried not to think about what a second, stronger one might feel like.

“Thanks,” he said. He meant it, in the way people mean it when they have no better currency.

He went upstairs and tried to call his mother from the laptop again. The call failed to connect. The spinning icon taunted him. He canceled it before it could fail on its own, as if control over the failure was better than the failure itself.

By dusk, the hostel had filled with the pre-game crowd, the air thick with sweat and rum and the electric optimism of people trying to outrun tomorrow. Marcus sat on his bunk with his laptop open and his phone charging at a trickle. The battery climbed from eleven to twelve to thirteen. He watched it like a stock ticker.

He opened Alan’s voicemail and listened again. Interest due Friday. Call me back. He glanced at the calendar. Thursday. He had less than twenty-four hours to make a plan that didn’t exist. He felt his chest tighten with the old, familiar panic, the one he used to be able to outrun with work and caffeine. It was harder to outrun in a dorm room with a flickering light.

He went up to the rooftop for air, carrying his phone like it might catch a better signal if it could see the sky. The rain had paused, leaving the concrete slick. The fairy lights sagged and half of them were dead, blinking in a lazy, uneven rhythm. The city below was a smear of neon and exhaust, a circuit board wrapped in humidity.

Ruth was there, perched on an overturned plastic chair, tapping ash into a puddle. She looked at him and raised an eyebrow. “Still chasing bars?” she asked.

“Just trying to make a call,” he said. He lifted the phone. One bar flickered, then died.

She snorted. “We should start charging tourists for the roof. ‘Premium signal experience. Includes existential dread.’” She took a drag and looked out over Khao San. “Did you see they taped a bigger sign on the bathroom?”

“Yeah,” he said.

“Will you listen to it?”

He laughed, a short, brittle sound. “I’m working on it.”

Ruth tilted her head. “You look like you’re running on fumes.”

“That’s basically my brand,” he said, then realized he meant it. He shifted his weight, felt the dampness under his shoes. “My phone keeps dying. It’s like the universe has taken my battery percentage personally.”

She smiled without showing teeth. “Maybe it’s telling you to stop optimizing and start eating.”

He wanted to tell her he had eaten. He didn’t want to admit that breakfast had been free toast and that lunch had been a coffee. He watched a tuk-tuk splash through a puddle and send a tiny spray into the air. A blue flicker sparked along a wire across the street and disappeared. No one noticed.

“I got a little zap today,” she said, casually, as if reporting the weather. “Shower on the third floor. Not bad, just a tickle. The staff shrugged. I shrugged back. We’re all just cooking slowly.”

Marcus felt a chill under the humidity. “That’s... great.”

She stubbed out the cigarette. “Bangkok doesn’t need you dead, mate. It’s too busy.” She stood and stretched. “Anyway. Good luck with your ghost calls.” She disappeared down the stairwell, leaving him alone with the humming wires and his phone’s dead screen.

He stood, because sitting felt like surrender. He grabbed his laptop and charger and headed down the stairs before he could talk himself out of it.

At the reception desk, Bee looked up. She saw the charger in his hand. Her mouth tightened.

“Don’t,” she said, quietly.

He paused. “I just need the WiFi,” he lied.

She shook her head. “No. Not tonight. Water is worse. Rain outside. You will get hurt.”

He wanted to argue, to tell her he was careful, to tell her he understood electricity, to tell her he had built a gaming PC at fifteen and lived to become a founder. He wanted to say, I am not stupid. He wanted to say, I am not disposable. Instead, he smiled and said, “Okay,” because he did not trust himself to say anything else.

He walked past her anyway.

The NO CHARGING sign had been replaced. It was larger now, a fresh sheet of printer paper taped flat to the door. DANGER — DO NOT CHARGE ELECTRONICS IN THIS BATHROOM. The letters were bold and uneven, the kind of all-caps that comes from a word processor and a person who is tired of being ignored.

He stared at it for a full second. He felt the warning land in him like a stone. Then he reached out, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.

---

The bathroom was louder than before, the hum of the light higher, the rain on the awning a constant roar. The puddle covered the entire floor, a shallow, gleaming sheet that reached the door and lapped against the base of the toilet. The air smelled of bleach, mildew, and something sharper, a metallic tang that made his sinuses flare. The outlet sat in the wall, its plate cracked wider than before, the corroded wire behind it more visible, more alive.

He set the laptop on the sink and opened it. Two bars of WiFi. His inbox was empty. The cursor blinked like a dare.

He checked his phone. Six percent. He felt the familiar calculation begin. Six was not enough for a call. Ten might be. Ten was the number that could hold a conversation if the signal didn’t drop, if the battery didn’t dive, if the world held still long enough.

He told himself: just a quick top-up. He told himself: no hands in the water. He told himself: stand on your toes if you have to. He told himself: you are not an idiot, you are an engineer of your own luck.

He plugged the adapter into the outlet.

A blue-white flash winked behind the plate. The light stuttered. The charger glowed green. The hum returned, thin and hungry. He felt the faint buzz in his fingers as he connected the phone to the laptop. The water around his feet was cold, slick. He shifted his weight and the puddle rippled outward in slow, concentric circles.

Seven percent.

He opened a new email to Alan. He typed: I can make the interest payment if you give me two more weeks. He stared at the sentence and deleted it. He typed: I need an extension. He deleted that too. He typed: I’m working on it. He left it there, cursor blinking at the end like it was waiting for a lie to finish.

Eight percent.

The light flickered. The hum rose and fell. The charger cable trembled slightly against the wall. He smelled burning plastic, faint but real. He told himself it was the cable warming up. He told himself that if he left at ten, it would be fine.

Nine percent.

A tingle started in his toes, the familiar fizzing sensation that had become part of this ritual. It crept up his arches like a tide. He lifted one foot and set it down again. The tingle stayed. He swallowed. His mouth tasted like pennies.

He thought about Bee’s warning, the fresh sign on the door, the way Somchai had said later never comes. He thought about his mother, about Lina’s texts, about the call he never managed to complete. He thought about Alan’s voicemail, about Matt’s polite rejection. He thought about the way his world had narrowed into a humid room and a percentage on a screen.

Ten percent.

He reached for the cord.

The outlet crackled, a dry snap from inside the wall. The light stuttered twice. The hum sharpened to a higher pitch. The water around his ankles shivered as if the floor had exhaled. He froze with his hand on the cable, breath held, eyes on the outlet.

He told himself, just one more percent. He told himself, make it a clean eleven. He told himself, you can do math, you can do physics, you can do this.

Eleven percent.

He yanked the adapter out. The charger light died. The hum faded. The bathroom light steadied. He stood there for a beat, breathing hard, feeling the tingle fade from his feet. He had gotten his number. He had won the smallest battle imaginable.

He tucked the phone into his pocket, laptop under his arm, and stepped out into the hallway. Bee was at the desk, eyes on her phone. She didn’t look up. He didn’t look at her. The silence between them was thick and wet and exhausted.

Upstairs, he sat on his bunk and tried to call Alan. The call rang once, then dropped. He stared at the dead screen. He tried his mother again. Voicemail. He left a message this time, voice low, words careful. “Hey, Mom. It’s Marcus. I’m okay. I’m sorry I keep missing you. I’ll call soon. I love you.” He hung up and felt the battery tick down to ten.

He lay back and stared at the ceiling stain. It had grown again, a slow bloom of water that never dried. He thought about how everything here seeped, how the walls remembered every leak. He thought about his own life, the way it had started to seep out through small failures, a drip he had ignored until it became a puddle.

He closed his eyes and listened to the building breathe. The fan clicked. The light flickered. The rain hit the roof in a steady, relentless rhythm. In the ground-floor bathroom, the outlet hummed quietly to itself, the puddle gathering again as if it knew he would return.

He told himself he was done with that room. He told himself the sign had gotten through. He told himself tomorrow he would find a better outlet, a better plan, a better version of himself.

Below, the light in the bathroom flickered once, and the hum rose into a thin, hungry note.

In the dark, Marcus waited for sleep and tried not to hear it.
