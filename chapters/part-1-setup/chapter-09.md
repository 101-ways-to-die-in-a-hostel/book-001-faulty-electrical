# Chapter 09: Grounding

Marcus woke to the sound of his phone dying, a soft electronic sigh that felt personal.

The screen blinked at him, a final red bar, then nothing. He stared at the blank rectangle for a beat, as if it might reconsider. It didn't. The dorm around him was already awake: zippers rasping, plastic bags crinkling, a muffled laugh on the far side of the room. The fan clicked overhead in its uneven rhythm, trying and failing to move the humidity.

He rolled the dead phone in his palm, feeling the warmth it no longer had. The laptop sat beside him, lid closed, the charging cable coiled like a sleeping snake. He thought about the call he had tried to make last night, about the ten percent that had bought him a dropped line and a voicemail he regretted leaving. He thought about his mother in her kitchen, seeing his number flash, deciding whether to answer, choosing voicemail because that was easier than whatever this was. He felt the familiar tightness in his chest and tried to ignore it.

A backpacker across from him dropped a shoe. It hit the floor with a wet slap. The ceiling stain had spread again, a darker edge creeping outward like a slow bruise. Marcus traced the shape with his eyes and wondered how long water could sit in a place before it became permanent.

He sat up, swung his legs over the side, and stepped onto the tile. Cool and damp. The floor in the dorm was always damp, the humidity finding its own level. He checked his Whoop band. LOW RECOVERY. It felt like the device was mocking him now.

He should go to the co-working space. He should spend the money and buy himself a day of clean WiFi and air-conditioned denial. He should call his mother from a chair that didn't rock under him. He should do a lot of things.

Instead, he opened his laptop and waited for it to wake. The battery read twenty-three percent. He hadn't plugged it in overnight. He couldn't remember if he had decided to be careful or if he had simply fallen asleep before making a choice. He plugged in the new charger at the outlet by his bunk, watched the little brick glow. It held steady. He waited for the flicker that sometimes came. It didn't. He exhaled, because he couldn't help himself. Relief came in tiny, unreliable doses now.

He opened his inbox. Nothing from Matt. Nothing from Alan. Lina had left a single message at 1:18 AM: Did you call? Mom didn't sleep.

He stared at the words until they stopped looking like language and became a pattern. He typed back, I'll call this morning. He hovered over send, then hit it before he could think about whether it was true.

He left the dorm with the laptop tucked under his arm and the dead phone in his pocket. The hallway smelled like disinfectant and damp concrete. The lights flickered in their familiar stutter. As he passed the STAFF ONLY door, he heard the low hum from below, the old electrical purr that seemed to pulse with the building's heartbeat. It was louder today, or maybe he was just quieter.

In the common room, Bee sat behind the desk, one earbud in, scrolling. The router blinked its tired green light on the wall. A British guy slept on a couch with a towel over his face, the kind of towel that was never going to dry. The toaster sparked when someone pushed it down, and Marcus flinched before he could stop himself.

He leaned on the bars at reception. "Morning," he said.

Bee looked up, took the earbud out. "Morning."

He hesitated, then asked, "Do you have a spare extension cord? Or another outlet that isn't..." He gestured vaguely upward, toward the dorms, toward the building in general.

She shook her head. "No. We use what we have."

"Is the owner around?" he asked, because he couldn't stop himself. "I wanted to talk about the WiFi. It keeps dropping. I could set up a mesh system. It would be cheap."

Bee's mouth twitched, not quite a smile. "Owner here yesterday. He says no. He says after high season." She said it in the same tone she used to describe the weather.

"It's monsoon," Marcus said, then realized how it sounded. "I mean... isn't this low season?"

She shrugged. "Always high season for problems." Then she looked at him with a flicker of something that might have been sympathy. "You need to charge?"

He shook his head too quickly. "No. Just WiFi."

She nodded once, the conversation already over. "Bathroom has best signal. But no charging. You know."

"I know," he said. He meant it. He also didn't.

He moved toward the window, opened his laptop, and tried to connect. One bar appeared, then vanished. He moved closer to the glass. Two bars flickered, then dropped. He raised the laptop, because sometimes desperation feels like a strategy. The cursor spun, the WiFi icon blinked. It felt like the system was teasing him.

He opened his phone, even though it was dead, and tapped his mother's name. The screen stayed black. He put it back in his pocket. He was not ready to call her from a phone that might die mid-sentence. He was also not ready to admit that was an excuse.

A notification pinged on his laptop, a pop-up from Twitter/X. The account @HostelReaper had posted again. He clicked without thinking.

Photo: a wet bathroom floor, a warning sign, a two-prong adapter lying in a puddle like a tiny corpse.

Caption: "If the floor is a mirror, the outlet is a liar. #FaultyElectrical"

He closed the tab so quickly he almost slammed the laptop shut. He told himself it was a coincidence. He told himself the internet was always full of people posting the same jokes about the same hazards, because the hazard was obvious and the joke was easy. He told himself he was not a pattern.

His inbox was still empty. The WiFi dropped again. He stood up, frustrated, and walked outside to the courtyard for air. The heat hit him like a wet towel. The street buzzed with engines and vendors, the smell of exhaust and frying garlic. A tangle of electrical wires sagged above the road, black and slick with rain. A drop fell from one and hissed against the metal of a tuk-tuk's roof. No one flinched.

He walked toward Samsen Road, thinking about the co-working space, the four hundred baht, the air-conditioned illusion of control. He checked his bank app on his laptop, because his phone was dead. The numbers stared back at him, smaller than yesterday. He did the math. He told himself the math would change if he worked harder, if he got a call back, if he sent one more email. He told himself, because he had to, that this was still a problem he could solve with enough input.

He turned around before he reached the co-working space. He walked back to the hostel, because four hundred baht felt like oxygen and he had already been breathing shallow for weeks. He told himself he would go tomorrow. He told himself tomorrow was always the day things started.

---

Around noon, the rain came back in a sharp, sudden sheet, the sky going the color of wet concrete. The hostel dimmed, the lights flickering as if the storm had found the building's heartbeat and started messing with it. The common room filled with damp bodies, all of them trying to charge, connect, or forget.

Marcus sat in the corner with his laptop, watching the WiFi icon blink its tiny green lie. He kept it open anyway, because closing it felt like giving up. His laptop battery climbed from twenty-six to twenty-eight on the dorm outlet, then stalled. The charger brick was warm when he touched it, a soft heat that made him check the wall as if he could see inside it.

He tried tethering to a hostel guest's hotspot, a German guy who was bragging about his unlimited data. The hotspot connected for eight seconds, then dropped. The German guy shrugged. "Too many devices," he said. "We are all vampires here."

Marcus laughed, not because it was funny but because it felt like the only acceptable response. He tried again. It failed again. He watched the German guy look at his phone and felt the edge of envy.

He took his laptop to the reception desk and asked Bee if he could move the router, just for a minute, to angle it toward the common room. She said no. He asked if he could reset it. She said no. She pointed at the note that said PLEASE DO NOT RESET and then pointed at him. "You reset, you break."

He wanted to explain that restarting a router was not breaking it, that he had done it a thousand times, that this was trivial. He swallowed the urge. It wasn't her job to take his lectures. It wasn't his job to give them.

He went upstairs and plugged the laptop into the wall again, staring at the outlet as if it might argue. The charger light flickered once, then steadied. He left it and sat on his bunk, waiting for the battery to climb to thirty, a number he didn't believe in but still wanted. The compass-tattoo guy glanced up from his bunk.

"You good?" he asked.

"Just working," Marcus said.

The guy laughed. "Man, you got the worst office in Bangkok." He shrugged and left, heading down the stairs with a towel around his neck.

Marcus opened his notes app and wrote a list, because lists were the language of control:

1) Call Mom
2) Call Alan
3) Find stable WiFi
4) Pay rent (somehow)

He stared at the list until it felt like a joke. He deleted it, then wrote it again. He told himself that writing a list meant he had a plan. It didn't, but it felt like it did.

He checked his email again. Still nothing. He opened LinkedIn, scrolled through a string of inspirational posts about resilience and failure, and felt his stomach twist. He closed it and opened his bank app again, then closed it again. He was a loop. The hostel was a loop. The rain was a loop. He was stuck in a circuit and couldn't find the breaker.

At two, a full power outage hit. The lights snapped off, the fan went silent, the room plunged into a sudden, thick dark. A chorus of groans rose from the dorm. Someone shouted, "Here we go." Marcus sat still, his laptop screen glowing like a small, weak lantern. The battery ticked down instead of up. He stared at it until the power came back, the lights flashing bright and then settling into their flicker. The charger light blinked, stuttered, then glowed. He felt the tiniest relief at the return of a hum that no longer felt like comfort.

He went downstairs to the common room and found Bee on the phone, speaking Thai quickly, her brow furrowed. She hung up and looked at him. "Power is bad today. Owner says maybe tomorrow." She sounded like she didn't believe him or herself.

"I can help," Marcus said, because it was his reflex. "I used to do electrical work. I mean, I can check the router, or the breaker, just to see."

Bee's eyes widened slightly. "No. Only owner. Basement not safe."

"I wouldn't touch anything," he said. He wasn't sure if that was a promise or a lie.

She held his gaze for a second. "You already touch things," she said. It wasn't harsh. It was a fact.

He felt his face heat. He looked away, down at his laptop, at the cable coiled in his hand like a leash. He wanted to argue. He wanted to say, I'm not a child. He wanted to say, I'm trying. He said nothing.

The owner came in through the courtyard door a few minutes later, a man in a crisp polo and sandals, his hair combed back like he still cared about appearances. Bee straightened when she saw him. He exchanged a few words with her in Thai, a quick, low conversation that carried the cadence of a familiar argument. Marcus caught fragments: money, rain, fix later. The man — Khun Prasit, the name he'd seen on the faded plaque by the desk — glanced at Marcus and then away, as if tourists were weather: present, inconvenient, not personal.

Bee pointed at the router, then toward the bathroom hallway, her finger a small, insistent line. Khun Prasit shook his head and made a slicing motion with his hand. He said something Marcus didn't understand, but the tone was clear: not now, not worth it, not his problem. Bee's mouth tightened. She dropped the subject the way you drop something that might burn.

Marcus felt the reflex to step in, to translate his frustration into a solution, to say, I can fix this. He had done it a thousand times in meetings. He had convinced people to believe in a pivot that didn't exist. He could convince a tired hostel owner to replace a router. He could convince him to fix a bathroom outlet. He could, in theory, save the day with a few words and a diagram. He stayed silent, because he didn't speak Thai and because he didn't want to hear himself fail in another language.

Khun Prasit walked toward the STAFF ONLY door and opened it with a ring of keys. The door swung wider than usual, and a gust of cool, damp air spilled out. Marcus saw the steep stairs descending into darkness and the panel box on the wall, the one with yellowed stickers and a warning triangle. The basement smelled like wet metal and old concrete. He could hear the hum down there, louder now, a low mechanical growl that sounded like a refrigerator struggling in a heatwave.

Somchai appeared beside him with the mop, nodding toward the open door. "He go check," Somchai said, as if explaining the obvious. "Sometimes power cut, he go down."

Marcus took a step toward the doorway before he could stop himself. The damp air licked his ankles. He peered down the stairs. A thin line of water ran down the middle, trickling from somewhere above, disappearing into the dark. The walls were stained with old moisture, a green-black patina that suggested the building had been quietly rotting for years. The panel box was open, exposing a tangle of wires and fuses that looked less like a system and more like a nest.

"Basement not safe," Somchai said gently, placing the mop handle across Marcus's path like a barrier. "Only owner."

"I'm not going down," Marcus said, though his foot was already on the first step. He didn't want to go down. He just wanted to look, to understand, to turn the unknown into a diagram he could solve. He took his foot back and let the mop handle stand.

Khun Prasit descended, his sandals slapping the wet steps. He stopped halfway, looked back up, and said something sharp to Bee. She nodded and stepped away from the door, her face flat. He turned his back to them and continued down, the light from the hallway cutting him into a silhouette. A second later, the hum deepened, and the lights in the hallway flickered in a slow, sick wave. Marcus felt the hair on his arms lift.

He told himself, absurdly, that if he had been allowed down there, he could have traced the fault. He could have found the loose wire, the missing ground, the place the current bled into the walls. He could have solved it with a screwdriver and a YouTube tutorial. He could have gotten himself electrocuted even faster. He didn't think about that last part.

The STAFF ONLY door stayed open while Khun Prasit was below. The basement air crept into the hallway, cool and metallic, and the hum vibrated through the tile. A few guests glanced over, curious, then went back to their phones. This place had its own rituals; a man going into the basement was just another one.

When Khun Prasit came back up, his polo was damp at the collar. He closed the panel box with a metallic clack and wiped his hands on a rag that had already seen a thousand wipes. He said something to Bee in Thai, and she nodded again, her eyes tired. He gave Marcus another glance, a brief weighing look, and then walked back out into the rain.

Bee watched him go. She looked at Marcus and said, in English this time, "He say power okay now. But rain again later. Maybe more cut."

"The bathroom outlet?" Marcus asked before he could stop himself.\n+\n+She shook her head. "Later. He say later." She said it without anger, just a flat, fatal repetition.\n+\n+Marcus nodded, not because he agreed, but because there was nothing else to do. Later was always where things went to die.\n+\n He spent the afternoon in the common room, waiting for the WiFi to blink alive long enough to send an email. It didn't. He watched the ring-light girl record a video about \"embracing analog life\" while secretly checking her phone under the table every thirty seconds. He watched a couple of Brits plug a charging strip into a power strip into another power strip, building a small tower of desperation that made the lights flicker harder. He watched Bee look at it, open her mouth, then decide it wasn't her battle.

He watched Bee look at it, open her mouth, then decide it wasn't her battle.

A few times, Marcus walked to the bathroom door and stopped, a hand on the knob, then turned away. He told himself he was done with that. He told himself he had been warned enough. He told himself his last tingle had been enough of a lesson. He told himself those things and believed them for ten minutes at a time.

By late afternoon, his phone was still dead and his laptop had crawled to thirty-one percent. He had not called his mother. He had not called Alan. He had not done anything that moved him forward. The rain eased, then returned. The lights flickered in their usual nervous rhythm. The hostel hummed, old wires pulling breath through damp walls.

He went upstairs, plugged in again, and tried to call his mother from the laptop. The call refused to connect on the weak WiFi. He stared at the spinning icon, a tiny wheel that felt like a verdict. He canceled the call before it could fail on its own.

He lay back on his bunk and stared at the ceiling stain. He watched the damp edge spread another millimeter and thought about how water always won if you gave it enough time.

---

At dusk, the rain stopped for a thin hour, and the hostel exhaled. The common room filled with the pre-game crowd again, louder, wetter, ready to drink away the pressure. The router blinked. The lights flickered. The air thickened with sweat and rum.

Marcus sat on his bunk with his laptop open, battery at twenty-nine, phone still dead. He had a message drafted to Alan that said, I need two more weeks, and another to his mother that said, I'm sorry. He didn't send either. The words felt too small for the holes they needed to fill.

At 8:12 PM, his phone finally flickered to life, a brief charging surge from the dorm outlet. The battery hit three percent. He seized the moment and tapped his mother's name, his thumb moving before his brain could argue.

The call rang once, then twice. It clicked to voicemail. He started to speak anyway, because he had already put his heart on the line and it felt worse to pull it back.

"Hey, Mom," he said. "It's me. I'm sorry I haven't called. I'm... I'm okay. I just wanted to hear your voice. I'll call again soon." He stopped before he could say what he actually meant, which was: I'm not okay, and I don't know how to fix this.

He hung up. The phone battery dropped to two percent. He watched the number like it was a timer on his life.

He picked up his laptop and went downstairs, because if the phone was dying, he could at least keep the laptop alive. He told himself he would use the outlet by the honor-system fridge, he would wait his turn, he would do it the safe way. When he got there, the outlet was buried behind a clump of chargers and adapters, a nest of white cords tangled like vines. Two Australians were arguing about whose plug was whose. Someone had plugged a fan into the strip and it was humming under the load.

He stood there for a minute, then stepped back. The noise in the common room was growing. He felt his head throb with it. He wanted quiet, signal, control. He wanted to not be this version of himself for five minutes.

He walked to the hallway and stopped outside the bathroom. The sign was still there. NO CHARGING. The tape had peeled further, the paper sagging. Someone had drawn a small skull beside the lightning bolt, a joke that wasn't. The door was slightly ajar, the faint hum leaking out like breath.

He told himself: just WiFi. Just ten minutes. No charging. He told himself the lie because it made the next step feel smaller.

He pushed the door open.

The bathroom smelled sharp and wet, bleach and mildew and the metallic tang that made his tongue itch. The floor was a sheet of water, deeper than before, a slick mirror that reached the door. The fluorescent light buzzed above him, louder now, as if the bulb was aging by the minute. The outlet sat in the wall, cracked and dark, the corroded wire behind the plate visible like a vein.

He stepped in, the water cool around his ankles. It felt thicker tonight, as if the rain had found another path into the room. He set his laptop on the sink and opened it. Two bars of WiFi. His inbox was still empty. The loading circle spun, then stopped. The silence of the internet felt heavier than the noise outside.

He opened his phone and watched the battery tick down from two to one. He had no more time. He could leave and let it die, or he could plug in and buy himself ten percent, a call, a chance. The decision felt less like a choice and more like gravity.

He took out the charger.

The adapter slid into the outlet with a soft click. A blue flash lit the crack for a heartbeat. The light above him flickered, then steadied. The charger glowed green. The outlet hummed, a thin, hungry note that made his teeth itch.

He connected his phone to the laptop and watched the battery climb to two. The number moved slowly, each percentage point a minute of his life he was selling for a call he couldn't make. He told himself he would leave at five, at ten, at whatever number felt safe. He told himself a lot of things.

The water around his feet felt colder than before, or maybe his feet were just numb. A faint tingle returned, the static fizz he had felt before, a warning whisper. He shifted his weight. The tingle followed. He told himself it was nothing, that he'd been here too long, that his nerves were jumpy.

Outside, the rain returned, sudden and hard, hammering the roof like an urgent demand. The light flickered in a stutter. The outlet crackled once, a dry snap from inside the wall. The charger light wavered but held.

Five percent.

He reached for the cord.

The hum rose into a higher pitch, a thin whine that made his jaw tighten. The water around his ankles shivered. The light blinked twice. He froze, his hand hovering over the cable, his breath shallow.

He thought about Bee's warning, Somchai's tired eyes, his father's voice. He thought about his mother, waiting for a call that never stuck. He thought about Alan, about Matt, about the debt that was a dark current under everything he did. He thought about how small his world had become, condensed to batteries and bars and a puddle.

The phone climbed to six percent. It wasn't enough. It was never enough.

He waited for seven.

The outlet hummed back.
