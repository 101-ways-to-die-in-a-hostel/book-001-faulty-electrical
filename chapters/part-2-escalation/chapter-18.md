# Chapter 18: Hot Swap

The shock was not a lightning bolt. It was a correction.

The instant his fingers closed around the plug, something went wrong in the background processes of his body. There was no bright flash, no Hollywood convulsion. Just a hard, humming nope that traveled up his hand and into his teeth, a quick pressure that made his jaw clamp. He felt his muscles lock for a fraction of a second, a micro-freeze that told him the wall had noticed him.

His first thought was not fear. It was, irrationally, branding: this was a bad user experience.

He let go. Or maybe he didn't and the wall let him go. The cable slipped in his hand and the plug thudded against the tile. The green light on the charger stayed on, patient and smug. His fingers tingled like they'd fallen asleep.

He held his hand up to the mirror. The skin looked the same, no blister, no black mark, nothing to prove that anything had happened. The mirror did not blink. His reflection was pale and damp and wearing blue-light glasses at midnight in a bathroom, which was not the image of a man in control.

He told himself it was static. He told himself humidity turned everything into static. He told himself he had once gotten a stronger shock from a doorknob in an Apple Store.

Then his tongue found a metallic taste at the back of his mouth, copper and ozone, and he stopped pretending for three long breaths.

The monsoon pushed rain against the building with a slow, heavy insistence. The bathroom light flickered in time with it, the fluorescent tube coughing in thin pulses. The puddle on the floor wobbled like a living thing, reflecting the green LED and his faintly shaking hands. He wiped his palm on his shorts and told himself he was fine.

He unplugged the charger anyway. The plug was warm, and he pictured a tiny current still marching through it, looking for a better route. He coiled the cable and shoved it into his bag with more force than necessary. He was done for the night. He was done because being done was safer than seeing what came next.

He turned the light off and opened the bathroom door. The hallway was empty, green-lit by the emergency bulbs. The air was cooler, and it felt like relief until his skin noticed how wet his socks were. He walked back to the dorm and tried to convince his heart to slow down.

In his bunk, he lay on his back and listened to the hostel breathe: pipes ticking, a distant laugh, rain on tin, a gecko chirp like a broken smoke alarm. His phone sat at forty-seven percent, and the number looked oddly small, like a battery level was a dare.

He opened Twitter because he didn't know what else to open. The feed was a blur of sunrises and stoic quotes and AI threads. There was a new @HostelReaper post: a close-up of a wall socket, charred on one side, with a caption that read, "When you feel the buzz, you are the circuit." He stared at it for a moment, then scrolled as if he hadn't.

He closed the app, set the phone face down, and stared at the slats of the bunk above him until the sleep came in shallow, frayed loops.

---

Morning arrived in a damp, grey mouth.

He woke to a buzzing alarm and the faint ache in his hand. The tingling was gone, replaced by a dull soreness in his palm, the kind you feel after gripping a dumbbell too long. He examined his skin again. There was a faint red spot near his thumb, so small it could have been a mosquito bite. He poked it until it stung and decided that settled it.

In the common room, the air was thick with wet laundry and instant coffee. The ceiling fan clicked, a small machine trying to convince itself it was helpful. Bee was at the desk, awake but tired, a stack of invoices on one side and a bowl of instant noodles on the other. Her eyes flicked to his hand and then away.

"You charge last night," she said.

It wasn't a question. The way she said it told him she already knew. He had a flash of guilt so quick he almost missed it.

"Just a bit," he said. "Needed to keep the phone topped."

She made a sound that wasn't quite a sigh. "You get shock?"

"No." The word came too fast.

She looked at him for a full beat and then glanced past him toward the bathroom. "Today no charge. Rain too much. Water in wall."

"I know," he said. "I'm not going to."

She nodded with the exhausted acceptance of someone who hears promises for a living.

A British guy in elephant pants barreled in from the hallway, dripping rain and indignation. "The shower on the third floor is biting people," he announced to the room like it was a comedy set. "Straight up zapped my elbow."

"Tell Bee," his friend said, not looking up from his phone.

"Tell Bee," he repeated, now looking at Bee.

Bee held up her hands. "We know. We tell boss. He say later." She said it calmly, like later was a weather pattern.

The British guy shook his head and laughed, but his laugh was thin. "Wild. You lot have a death wish."

Marcus felt the words land in the room and then bounce off him, the way darts bounce off a wall when you throw them hard enough.

He made coffee, drank it too fast, and opened his laptop at a table by the window. The WiFi in the common room lagged, the little spinner spinning like a cheap toy, and he felt his throat tighten with each slow load. He had an email from Priya asking for a quick clarification on "liabilities and pending legal matters" and another from Alan, the lender, asking for the call he had been avoiding.

He took a breath and drafted a reply to Priya, the kind of reply you write when you need to sound confident while standing on loose tile. He attached a spreadsheet and hit send. The progress bar hung at eighty percent. He watched it as if it were a countdown timer.

The lights flickered. The fan hiccupped. The WiFi dropped to one bar.

He closed his eyes. He felt the familiar heat of frustration, a hot current that always ran under his ribs when things didn't work. He could go to the cafe. He could wait. He could go to the bathroom. The bathroom was always waiting.

He remembered the jolt from last night and felt a small, involuntary shiver in his hand. He shoved that feeling into the same folder as fear of flying and dented rental cars. He didn't have time for that file.

The front door opened with a gust of wet air. A street vendor stepped into the lobby with a bag of adapters and chargers slung over his shoulder. "Cable? Adapter? Fast charge?" he sang out. Bee shook her head. Marcus went anyway.

"How much?" he asked.

"One-fifty," the vendor said, holding up a white adapter that looked identical to the one in Marcus's bag, only newer and cleaner.

Marcus opened his wallet. The bills were thin. He bought it anyway. It felt like buying insurance from the person who started the fire.

"Safe?" he asked, half joking.

The vendor shrugged. "Dry, safe. Wet, no." His English was simple, his meaning clear.

Marcus smiled like that answered him. "Thanks," he said, and tucked the adapter into his pocket.

He tried to work in the common room for another hour. The upload never finished. The WiFi kept dropping. His phone battery held at forty-two percent, a number that still felt too small for someone who might get a call any minute. Alan's email glowed on his screen. He didn't open it.

By noon, the rain had returned with the confidence of a recurring character. Water pooled by the front door. Somchai mopped it back into the drain, the bucket sloshing in weary circles. The bathroom door kept opening and closing, the sign flapping like a flag in a storm.

Marcus watched the puddle in the hallway slowly expand. It crept toward the bathroom and then beyond it, a wet border that didn't care about the rules.

He told himself he would go to the cafe after lunch. He told himself he would stay out of the bathroom. He told himself it would be fine.

He tried the courtyard first, a compromise. The back door opened to a narrow strip of wet concrete, a couple of plastic chairs, and a spirit house tucked under the eaves. The rain came in sideways, beading on the little roof of the spirit house, making the tiny offerings look damp and defeated. Somchai was there, wringing out a mop with the patience of someone who had done this for decades. He nodded at Marcus and then nodded toward the puddle creeping back in from the hallway as if to say, it never leaves.

Marcus pulled out his phone and watched the WiFi bars wobble between one and none. He took one step left and the bars disappeared. One step right and they came back. He laughed once, low. The building felt like a puzzle designed by someone who hated him.

Ruth pushed through the courtyard door with a cigarette tucked behind her ear and a towel draped over her shoulder. She stopped when she saw him and lifted her chin. "You look like a man who thinks a different angle will fix physics," she said.

"Just looking for signal," he said.

"Signal is everywhere. Grounding isn't," she said, and nodded toward the wet concrete. She held up her arm and pointed to a thin white scar near her elbow. "Vietnam, 2018. Shower bit me. I thought it was cute until my arm went numb for an hour." She said it like a weather report.

"You were fine," he said.

"Yeah," she said. "Fine is a temporary state." She flicked her cigarette into a puddle and watched the ember hiss. "Be careful, Shark. The building doesn't care about your hustle."

He wanted to say he wasn't hustling. He wanted to say he was just surviving. He said, "Thanks," because it was easier.

He went back inside, past the front desk, past the wall of rules, past the board that listed "LOCAL TIPS" in bright marker. Someone had added, in smaller letters, "Do not charge in bathroom. Seriously." The handwriting wasn't Bee's. It looked like a guest had written it after learning the hard way.

He went to the bathroom anyway.

---

The new adapter felt slick, too smooth, like it hadn't been worn in by risk yet.

The bathroom was warmer in the afternoon, the air thick and soft, almost like a sauna. The puddle was still there, wider now, a shallow lake that hid the tile pattern. He set his laptop on the sink and pulled the adapter from his pocket. The handwritten sign hung crookedly, one corner peeling away, the word NO stretched into a droop.

He hesitated, the way he did before a pitch, the moment where you know you could still step back and the world wouldn't punish you for it. He wasn't used to stepping back.

The adapter slid into the outlet with a soft click. The green light appeared. No spark. He let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding.

"See," he told himself. "New adapter, new outcome." It was the kind of logic that worked in product meetings. He needed it to work here.

He plugged his phone in first, then the laptop. The battery icon climbed slowly. The WiFi bars steadied at three. He opened his email and watched the upload resume. The progress bar began to creep forward, slow but moving.

A drip fell from the shower head, one slow drop every ten seconds, a cheap metronome. He could hear the rain through the vent, a constant hiss. He could hear the building hum, a low electrical note that felt like it was coming from the walls themselves.

He kept his feet planted on the driest patch of tile he could find, the place where Somchai's mop had been kind. The water still lapped at his shoe, but he told himself the rubber was enough. The vendor had said dry, safe. This was mostly dry.

A vibration buzzed in his pocket. He checked his phone. A call from Lina.

He glanced at the upload bar and the battery percentage. Forty-six percent. The bar was at eighty-seven. He answered.

"Hey," he said, the word coming out too bright.

"Marcus," she said, relief and concern tangled together. "Mom's worried. You haven't called in days."

"I know," he said. He kept his voice low. The bathroom was a small room; the words felt loud. "I'm just busy. I'm fine."

"You said that last time. And the time before that." He heard her take a breath. "Are you actually okay?"

He stared at the puddle and the green light and the slow drip. He thought about telling her the truth, about saying, "I'm standing in a bathroom charging my laptop because the WiFi is better here and I can't afford the cafe and I got a shock last night." He didn't.

"I'm fine," he said. "Just a lot going on."

"You sound tired."

"Time zones," he said. He made it a joke and hated himself for it.

"Mom wants to know if you're safe." Lina's voice was softer. "She read something about hostels in Thailand and electrical fires."

He laughed, and the laugh sounded wrong in the small room. "I'm safe," he said. "It's a little sketchy, but I'm careful."

He heard the drain gurgle, a wet, unhappy sound. He watched the upload bar tick to ninety percent.

"Okay," Lina said, unconvinced. "Just call her. Even for a minute."

"I will," he lied.

"And stop charging your electronics in weird places," she added, which made his stomach drop in a way he didn't understand.

"Why would I do that?" he said, as if the bathroom wasn't glowing around him.

She didn't laugh. "Just be careful," she said. "You're not invincible, you know."

He almost said, "I am." Instead he said, "I know."

They hung up. The line went quiet. He stood there with the phone in his hand, the green light reflected in the puddle like a small, patient eye.

The upload finished. The email sent. He should have left. He should have unplugged and walked away. He stayed to charge a little more, because he had already stayed this long and the logic in his head said it would be inefficient not to.

A buzz ran up his wrist, faint and insistent, like a mosquito inside the cord. He shook his hand and the sensation left but not before he noticed it. He stared at the adapter and saw, for the first time, a thin line of moisture along the edge of the plate. It glistened in the fluorescent light and slid down, slow as a decision.

He wiped it with his thumb. The plate felt warm.

He told himself warmth meant usage, usage meant normal, normal meant safe. He told himself that because it was easier than admitting he had already decided.

The phone hit fifty percent. He unplugged it. The outlet gave a soft snap, the smallest pop, like a knuckle cracking. The light flickered, then steadied.

He coiled the cord and reached for the laptop. A dull click sounded from somewhere in the wall. The fluorescent tube dimmed for a heartbeat, then brightened. He felt the hair on his arms lift.

He held the laptop against his chest and stepped toward the door. His shoe slid on the wet tile. He caught himself on the sink, and his fingers brushed the metal faucet. A tiny sting ran up his arm. He yanked his hand back as if it were a snake.

He stared at the faucet. He stared at his hand. He laughed once, a tight sound.

"Static," he said to the room. "Humidity."

He left before the room could disagree.

By late afternoon, the hostel was a stew of wet shoes and slow complaints. The storm had parked itself over Khao San and refused to move. The street looked like a shallow river, tuk-tuks pushing wakes past the doorway. The WiFi sputtered as more guests retreated inside and streamed video to pass the time. Every new device felt like a small strain on the system, each one demanding a little more current than the building could afford.

Marcus sat at the edge of a couch with his laptop balanced on his knees and watched the call time tick by. Alan had sent another email: "Call me by 6pm Bangkok time. This is not optional." The words sat in his inbox like a fist.

He took a breath and tapped call.

The connection was bad. His voice lagged behind his mouth. Alan's image appeared and froze, his face caught mid-sentence, his eyes half closed. The audio cut, returned, cut again. Marcus felt his chest tighten.

"Marcus," Alan's voice crackled. "I can barely hear you."

"I'm getting a better signal," Marcus said. "Give me two minutes."

He stood, laptop in hand. The cords dragged behind him like a tail. He could feel the room watching him, the way people watch someone make a choice they've already made a hundred times.

Bee looked up from the desk. She met his eyes and shook her head, slow and tired.

"Just five minutes," he mouthed, as if a silent promise counted for more.

He walked toward the bathroom.

The hallway was darker now, the emergency lights casting green pools on the tile. The puddle had escaped into the corridor, a slick tongue licking at his shoes. He stepped over it and pushed the door.

Inside, the air was thick and warm. The light buzzed. The puddle was deeper than it had been an hour ago, water pooled all the way to the toilet base. He could hear the rain through the vent, louder now, a constant roar.

He set the laptop on the sink, the screen still showing Alan's frozen face. He plugged in the new adapter. The green light came on. He heard a faint crackle and told himself it was nothing. He switched his phone to hotspot and watched the WiFi bars climb.

"I'm back," he said, and tapped to unmute.

Alan's face unfroze. "There you are," he said, the tone of someone who expected compliance. "What is going on, Marcus? I need a payment schedule."

Marcus leaned against the wall, the cold tile soaking through his shirt. He opened his mouth and started to explain, the words lining up like a pitch deck in his head. He talked about pipeline, about traction, about a possible term sheet. He talked about Bangkok as if it were a strategic choice and not a retreat.

The puddle rose around his shoes. He could feel the water seeping through the fabric, cool at first, then strangely warm. He adjusted his stance and felt the buzz in the wall deepen, a low vibration under his soles.

"You are telling me the same story," Alan said. "I need numbers. I need dates."

Marcus swallowed. He felt sweat on his neck. The light flickered once, a brief blink, and the laptop fan spun up like a tiny engine. He kept talking.

"Give me two more weeks," he said. "I have a call tomorrow with a fund. If that lands, we clear you."

Alan made a sound that was more exhale than laugh. "Marcus, I've heard this. I'm giving you until Friday. If I don't see payment, I move to collections."

The words hit him like a slap. He opened his mouth to argue and found no air. The bathroom felt smaller, the air thicker. The light buzzed louder. He felt the water climb higher against his shoes.

"Friday," he repeated, buying time.

"Friday," Alan said. "Do not make me chase you."

The call dropped for a half-second, then resumed. Marcus gripped the phone tighter, his knuckles whitening. The cable lay across his wrist, a warm line. He ignored it.

"Okay," he said. "Friday."

He ended the call and stood there, listening to the rain and the hum and the drip. His chest felt hollow, the space inside him wide and cold. He stared at his reflection in the mirror, at the blue light of the laptop screen washing his face, at the water pooling at his feet.

He had to send an email. He had to update Priya. He had to answer Lina. He had to do a hundred things. He had to be in a different place.

He opened a new email and began to type. His fingers moved fast, because speed felt like control. The phone battery ticked up. The laptop battery climbed. The puddle warmed.

The light flickered again. He smelled something sharp, like a plastic toy held too close to heat. He looked at the adapter and saw, for a second, a thin wisp of smoke, or maybe he imagined it. He blinked and it was gone.

He told himself it was the rain, the damp, the smell of the hostel. He told himself he was tired. He told himself he could handle this.

The email to Priya was three sentences long. He stared at the cursor, blinking. He should send it. He should leave. He should. He didn't.

He watched the water ripple as a drop fell from the shower head. He watched the reflection of the green light tremble in the puddle. He watched his own face, pale and intent, in the mirror.

The power flickered. The screen dimmed, brightened. The hum in the wall deepened to a low growl. He felt it through his feet, a vibration that was too steady to ignore.

He glanced at his shoes. The water had crept over the soles now. He could feel it inside the fabric, cold against his toes.

He thought about taking the shoes off. He thought about standing on the toilet seat. He thought about putting a towel down. He thought about how ridiculous all of it would sound in a pitch meeting.

He decided to move anyway. He shifted his stance, his heel slipping on the tile. His foot found a dry corner for a second, then the water followed. The puddle did not care about his plans.

His phone buzzed. A new email from Priya: "Can we talk tonight?"

He stared at it. The light flickered. The puddle warmed. The adapter hummed, patient and dangerous.

He typed, "Yes," and hit send.

He stayed.

He stayed because he needed the battery. He stayed because the call might come any minute. He stayed because leaving felt like failure, and he had built his life on avoiding that feeling at all costs.

The rain hammered the roof. The walls sweated. The outlet glowed green.

He did not move his feet.

---

When he finally unplugged, the outlet snapped with a tiny flash, the now-familiar flare of blue-white light. He flinched and laughed at himself for it. The laugh sounded thin, stretched.

He stepped out into the hallway and felt the cool air on his face. The lights were dimmer now, the emergency bulbs doing most of the work. He walked back toward the dorm with his bag heavy on his shoulder and his phone at fifty-eight percent, a number that still felt like a hostage.

He passed the reception desk. Bee was there, her eyes on her phone. She looked up as he passed, saw his damp shoes, the cable coiled in his bag, and said nothing. Her silence felt heavier than any warning.

In the dorm, the air was hotter than before. The fan ticked. Someone snored with an open mouth. Marcus lay down on his bunk and stared at the ceiling, his heart still beating too fast.

He tried to sleep. He couldn't. Every time he closed his eyes he saw the green light in the puddle, the way it reflected like an eye. He saw the small flash of blue. He felt the sting in his hand.

He opened his phone and checked the battery again. Fifty-seven. He checked his email. No reply from Priya. He checked LinkedIn and scrolled past a post about "grind culture" and "sleep is a feature." He laughed, a short bark, and put the phone down.

The rain did not stop. The hostel hummed. The wall between him and the bathroom held its secret currents like a loaded gun.

He told himself he would not go back tonight. He told himself the morning would be better. He told himself the adapter was new, the risk lower, the plan intact.

He closed his eyes and listened to the building breathe.

Somewhere downstairs, the fluorescent light buzzed. A pipe ticked. A puddle grew.

He slept anyway.
