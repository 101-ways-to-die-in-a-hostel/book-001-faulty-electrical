# Chapter 20: Arc Fault

The surge came with a taste.

It wasn't a sound first, or a light. It was the sudden copper tang on his tongue, like he'd bitten into a penny. Then the fluorescent tube above him popped and flared, and the bathroom went bright enough to bleach the world.

His hand was still hovering over the plug. His phone was still buzzing. The water around his shoes jittered with little rings, like it was boiling from somewhere underneath. The outlet made a short, sharp crack. His laptop screen flickered to black and back. The hair on his arms lifted.

In the fraction of a second where his body still believed it could choose, he chose wrong. He grabbed the plug.

The jolt was not a lightning bolt. It was more insidious than that, a hard, cold bite that ran up his wrist and into his elbow. His fingers snapped open on their own. The plug shot out of the outlet and slapped against the sink with a plastic clatter. His whole arm tingled, a deep vibration that didn't match his heartbeat.

He stumbled backward, heel sliding on wet tile. The back of his knee hit the toilet bowl and he sat down hard, the cracked seat shifting under him. His glasses fogged. He blinked and saw the outlet plate glowing faintly around the edges, a thin blue halo that faded as quickly as it came.

He stared at his hand as if it belonged to someone else. The skin looked normal. He flexed his fingers. They moved. The tingling faded to a pins-and-needles itch. He laughed once, a small, involuntary puff of air that came out like a cough.

"Static," he said out loud, because if he named it that, it would fit into a column of safe, familiar explanations. "Just static. Humidity. Synthetic socks."

The bathroom light steadied. The hum in the wall sank back to its usual faint complaint. The rain hammered the roof, a heavy percussion that made everything else feel less immediate.

His phone had fallen from the sink into the puddle. The screen was still on. A message glowed through the water: "Call me. - Jonah". The text floated above the ripples like a life raft.

He leaned down and fished the phone out, water streaming from the case. The screen kept working. He wiped it on his shirt and held it to his ear.

"Jonah?" he said.

No response. He had missed it. The call had already rung out. The phone buzzed again, but it was a notification from a meditation app telling him to breathe.

He put the phone on the sink and stared at the outlet. The plug dangled from its cord, swaying. A thin curl of smoke rose from the adapter's prongs, more vapor than flame, but enough to make his throat tighten.

He grabbed a towel from the hook and patted the plug dry like it was a pet that had fallen in a pool. The towel came away with a brown smudge. He sniffed it. Burnt plastic.

A rational person would have taken this as a hard stop. He was not that person. He was a man who built his identity on pushing through constraints. He had also spent two hours convincing himself that he needed forty percent battery to survive the night.

He plugged the charger into his power bank instead, the small gray brick he'd bought in an airport in 2017. It flickered green, then settled. He didn't dare put the adapter back into the wall. He told himself he was making a smart pivot.

The bathroom door creaked open behind him.

"Marcus." Bee's voice was a low hiss, the kind you used in a library or a war zone. "What you do?"

He turned. She stood in the doorway holding a mop, her hair damp, her uniform shirt clinging to her shoulders. The light from the hallway made her a silhouette. In her face, he could see the exact mix of exhaustion and anger that said she had spent too much time warning people who refused to be warned.

"It just... surged," he said, trying to keep his voice light. "I unplugged it. All good."

She walked in and looked at the outlet. The crack in the plate was black now. The tiny hand-written sign lay face down in the puddle, its letters bleeding into blue mush.

"You see?" she said, pointing. "That is danger. You feel?"

He held up his hand. "Just a little zap. I'm fine."

"Not fine." She put the mop down and reached for the sink, her fingers stopping short of the wet edge. "This is old building. When rain, electricity go crazy. You in water. You die." She said it flatly, not dramatic, not trying to scare him. It was the same tone she'd used to tell him the laundry machine ate coins.

He wanted to argue. He wanted to say 220 volts is only dangerous if the current has a path. He wanted to talk about insulation and adapters and his Apple charger being safer than whatever was on the market here. He wanted to tell her that he understood electricity better than she did.

Instead, he lifted his shoulders and said, "It was a fluke. I'll be careful." He picked up his phone and power bank, both now damp, and slid past her.

"No bathroom charging," she said again, as if repetition could break through stubbornness. "Use common room."

"The WiFi in the common room is trash," he said before he could stop himself.

She stared at him. "Trash is better than dead."

It should have landed. It did land, somewhere in his chest. He felt it, a heavy thud of meaning. He didn't acknowledge it. He kept walking.

In the hallway, his shoes squeaked on the wet tile. The emergency lights threw long green shadows. His arm still tingled, and he shook it out like a dog shaking rain.

He told himself this was data. The surge was a variable. The solution was to avoid the outlet in the bathroom during storms. He had learned. He had adapted. That was the story he told himself as he walked back into the common room and sat at a plastic table under a flickering light.

He plugged his phone into the power bank and watched the battery climb. Thirty-nine. Forty. Forty-one. He felt his heartbeat slow.

A girl with glitter on her cheeks slid a beer toward him. "You look like you touched a live wire," she said, half joking.

He managed a smile. "I did."

She blinked, unsure if he was serious, then laughed and moved on. The room around him was loud with the easy noise of people who still believed the night was about fun. Someone was playing cards on the couch, slapping them down too hard. A guy in a tank top was telling a story about a monkey stealing his GoPro. Marcus nodded at the right moments but didn't listen. He had his phone in his hand like a talisman.

His inbox refreshed. No new message from Jonah.

He opened a note on his phone and typed "Power surge. Bathroom outlet dangerous. Use common room." He stared at the words and felt ridiculous. He deleted it. He didn't need to document his own near-miss. He needed to keep moving.

His phone buzzed again. This time it was a number he didn't recognize, with an area code from California. He answered too quickly, nearly dropping it.

"Marcus?" A woman's voice. Older. Calm. "It's Mom."

He froze. His mother never called this late unless something was wrong, or unless she was convinced he wouldn't answer during normal hours. The word "Mom" hit his chest harder than the surge.

"Hey," he said, already forcing his voice into a frequency she wouldn't hear the panic in. "What's up?"

"I couldn't sleep," she said. "I checked your posts. You look... tired."

"It's the time difference," he said. "Bangkok is not exactly optimized for Silicon Valley sleep cycles."

She hummed. "Are you safe?"

"Of course." He said it like a fact, like he'd checked the metrics. He glanced at his damp sleeve, the faint scorch mark on the adapter. He looked away. "It's a hostel. It's fine."

There was a pause. He could hear the hum of his parents' kitchen refrigerator through the phone, the most boring sound in the world. It made him homesick and angry at the same time.

"Marcus," she said, and her voice softened. "I'm not calling to lecture you. I'm calling because I had a dream. You were standing in water. And you were holding something."

He laughed, a short, forced laugh. "That's very Freud." He tried to make it a joke. "I was probably charging my laptop."

"Don't," she said. It was the same word Bee had used, the same flat certainty, but her voice held a tremor. "If you're wet, if the outlet is bad, just don't."

"Mom, I know what I'm doing." He hated how quickly the defensiveness came. It was muscle memory.

"Do you?" she asked. "Because you told me you were staying in a 'co-living innovation hub' and then I saw the photos. It looks like a bunk bed on a rainy street."

He looked at the stained ceiling above the common room, the single tube light buzzing in sync with his pulse. "I'm testing assumptions," he said. "I need to be here. This is the market."

"Your market can wait until you have dry shoes," she said. "Please."

He wanted to say something sharp, something about how she didn't understand, how she had never built anything without help. Instead, he closed his eyes and let the exhaustion wash over him.

"I'll be careful," he said.

She exhaled. "Call your sister tomorrow."

"I will."

"And if you need help..." She didn't finish the sentence. She didn't have to. It meant money, a ticket home, a safety net. It was the lifeline she always offered and he always refused, because accepting it meant admitting his own failure.

"I'm fine," he said. "Really."

After they hung up, he stared at his phone for a long time. He told himself he was annoyed at her for worrying. He told himself he was annoyed because she might be right.

The rain didn't let up. The roof leaked in the corner of the common room, the water hitting a plastic bucket with a steady plink. Someone had drawn a cartoon lightning bolt on the bucket in black marker. Marcus wondered when that had become funny.

He got up and walked to the front desk. Bee was there, flipping through a logbook, her phone next to her like a small moon. He leaned on the counter.

"Is there another place with good WiFi?" he asked.

She didn't look up. "All same."

"What about the rooftop?"

"Rooftop is wet. No lights. And wind."

"What about the cafe next door?"

"Closed because rain."

"What about..." He stopped. He already knew the answer.

Bee looked up then, her eyes tired but direct. "You can sit in common room. Not bathroom."

"I was just asking."

"Because you want to go bathroom."

He didn't deny it. He didn't admit it either. He asked, instead, "Has anyone ever... you know."

"Die?" Bee said the word like it was the obvious conclusion. "Not here. But other hostel. Same street. Three years ago. Woman. Phone charger. Wet floor."

The word die landed hard. It was the most explicit warning anyone had given him. Not a caution, not a rule, but a story with an outcome.

"Was it..." he started.

"Electricity. Heart stop." Bee tapped her chest twice. "Police came. Owner paid. People forget." She flipped a page in the logbook. "I don't forget."

He opened his mouth. He wanted to say it was different, that her story was an outlier, that he was smart, that he used a surge-protected Apple adapter. He wanted to say he had felt the zap and survived, which meant the risk was low. He wanted to wrap statistics around a ghost.

Instead, he said, "I'm sorry."

Bee nodded, accepting the apology as a small gift that didn't change anything. She went back to her book.

He walked away with the word die following him like a shadow.

Ruth was in the common room now, sitting cross-legged on a couch with a bottle of water. Her hair was still damp from the rain. She patted the seat beside her without looking.

"Bee told you, huh?" she said.

"What?"

"The dead woman story." She took a sip. "They tell that to the ones who keep wandering toward the bathroom with cords in their hands."

He sat. He didn't deny it.

"I've told you before," Ruth said. "You can be smart or you can be alive. Those aren't always the same choice."

"I'm still alive," he said.

"So far." She tilted her head. "You got shocked?"

"A little. It was nothing."

"That's not nothing." She leaned back, the couch springs squeaking. "The universe doesn't give you practice shocks."

He snorted. "The universe doesn't give a shit about my outlets."

"That's the point." She looked over at him, her eyes steady. "Do you know how much current it takes to stop a heart? Not much. Less than the charger in your bag. You want to treat it like an inconvenience. It's not."

He wanted to talk about amps and resistance, about wet skin and threshold currents, about how the body could handle short bursts. He'd read enough to assemble a paragraph. He didn't say any of it. He picked at the label on his power bank.

"I'm not going back in there tonight," he said, which was true in the moment.

"Good." She nudged his shoulder. "Then stay out."

He nodded and lied with his body, the small tilt of his head that made people think he agreed.

His phone buzzed. Jonah again, a short text: "Can you jump on a quick call later? Maybe midnight your time."

Midnight. Two hours away. He checked his battery. Fifty-one. The power bank had done its job, but the laptop was still at twelve. He needed the laptop for the deck, for screen sharing, for the illusion of competence. He needed the WiFi. He needed the bathroom.

He told himself he wouldn't. He told himself the common room was fine. He told himself he could tether his phone and it would work. He told himself a lot of things.

He went upstairs anyway, to his bunk, to get the laptop. He told himself he was just grabbing it, not going to the bathroom. He told himself he was going to try the rooftop, maybe the signal would be better. He told himself he would see.

In the dorm, the air was thick and warm, the fan turning slow circles like it was tired of effort. A guy in the top bunk was watching a movie on his phone with the sound off, the subtitles a silent flicker. Marcus slid his laptop out of his bag and felt its weight like a promise.

His phone buzzed again. A message from Lina: "Mom said you talked. Please be careful."

He didn't respond. He dropped the phone into his pocket and headed back toward the stairs.

The hallway was darker now. The emergency lights cast their sickly glow. The bathroom door was closed, the sign taped back up with fresh tape, the letters smudged but legible: NO CHARGING. The puddle in the hallway had grown, a thin ribbon of water leading from under the door toward the stairs.

He stepped over it and kept going, because the common room was downstairs and he had decided that was his plan.

He sat at a table, opened his laptop, and watched the WiFi bars vanish. The router had given up. The page refused to load. He stared at the spinning circle and felt his jaw tighten. He tethered his phone, watched the signal show one bar, then drop to zero. The rain had eaten the street, maybe the whole block. The cell towers were flailing too.

He closed the laptop and opened it again, the ritual of a man who wanted to believe persistence was a solution. It wasn't.

He walked to the front desk. Bee was still there, now with a cup of instant coffee. He could smell the burnt powder.

"WiFi dead," he said.

She nodded. "Rain."

"Do you have a router restart?"

She looked at him like he had asked if she could reboot the monsoon. "No."

"Is there a backup?"

"No."

He stared at her, waiting for a way out. There wasn't one. He could feel the clock ticking toward midnight, toward Jonah's call. He imagined the call failing, the opportunity slipping, the email turning into silence. He felt panic nibble at the edges of his composure.

"There is a little signal in the bathroom," Bee said, and he could hear the resignation in her voice. She hated that she was giving him a reason. "But no charge. Only message. You can stand in door."

He latched onto that. It was a loophole. He could stand in the doorway, no water, no outlet. He could take the call and be safe. He could get away with it.

"Thanks," he said, already moving.

He walked down the hall again, laptop under his arm. The bathroom door was closed. The sign was still there. He peeled it up and stuck it to the wall beside the door, a small act of rebellion disguised as cooperation.

He opened the door and let the warm, wet air wash over him. The light buzzed. The puddle on the floor was larger now, a mirror reflecting the ceiling. He stayed in the doorway, one foot on dry tile, one foot on the threshold. He held his laptop like a shield. He checked his phone. Fifty-three percent. Enough for a call. The laptop battery sat at twelve, still red.

He tethered his phone and watched the WiFi bars appear. Two. It was enough. He took a breath and waited.

The call didn't come at midnight. It didn't come at twelve-oh-five. He refreshed his inbox, checked his messages, refreshed again. The only new text was from a random travel agency offering a tour discount. He deleted it and waited.

Standing in the doorway, he could see the outlet on the wall, the crack in the plate now dark and wet. A thin line of water ran down the wall beneath it. He could hear the hum behind it, a low, steady vibration. He could smell ozone, faint but present, the way you could smell rain before it hit. He told himself the smell was just from the fluorescent ballast. He told himself a lot.

At twelve-twenty, his phone buzzed. Jonah's name. His throat tightened. He hit answer.

"Marcus," Jonah said, and the relief in that one word made Marcus's knees go weak.

"Hey," he said. He shifted his weight, still keeping his foot on the threshold, still avoiding the puddle.

"I can only talk for ten minutes," Jonah said. "I'm walking between meetings."

"Ten is great," Marcus said. He opened his laptop, the screen flashing low battery. The WiFi bars held steady at two. He started screen sharing, hoping the battery would hold. "I can run you through the deck in five."

He launched into his pitch, voice bright, words smooth. He talked about frictionless travel payments and decentralized communities, about a pivot toward actual revenue. He used the words he knew worked: scale, leverage, synergy. Jonah said "uh-huh" and "interesting" and nothing that felt like commitment.

As he spoke, the bathroom light flickered. The screen on his laptop dimmed. He clicked to the next slide faster. He could feel the hum in the wall deepen, a faint vibration through the air. He ignored it.

"The ask is small," he said. "Fifty for the bridge."

"That's bigger than it sounds," Jonah said. "Who's leading?"

"I have interest," Marcus lied. "I'm finalizing a term sheet."

The light flickered again, longer this time. The WiFi bars dipped to one. The screen froze on the slide with the word "TRACTION" in bold. He kept talking as if the visuals were still moving.

"Look, Marcus," Jonah said, voice softer now. "I like you. I like the hustle. But it's a tough market. Crypto travel is... it's a lot."

He heard the word no, buried in the softness. He kept talking anyway, because that was what he did when he felt a door closing. "That's why now is the moment," he said. "We're small enough to pivot and still win."

Another flicker. The laptop chimed a low battery warning. He minimized it and kept going. He could feel the sweat under his arms, the dampness in the air, the way the water on the floor seemed to creep toward his shoe even though he knew it was just his imagination.

"Send me an updated deck," Jonah said. "A tighter one. Two pages. I'll see if anyone bites."

"I can send it tonight," Marcus said. "I can send it in an hour."

"Great. Talk soon." The line clicked. The call ended.

Marcus stared at the phone. The call was over. It had not been a yes. It had not been a no. It had been a maybe, which was somehow worse.

The laptop battery flashed red. Eight percent. He could still send the deck if he moved fast. He could still use the bathroom outlet if he dared. He could still do what he shouldn't.

He looked at the outlet. He looked at the puddle. He looked at the threshold, the safe line he had set for himself.

"Just two pages," he said out loud, as if the bathroom could hear him. "Just a quick export."

He stepped one foot into the room. The tile was slick under his shoe. The water touched the rubber sole and stopped. He felt the cold seep in. He stepped again, this time fully inside. The door swung inward behind him, clicking against the wall.

He set his laptop on the sink. He opened the power bank. It was nearly empty. The green light blinked and died. He couldn't use it. He stared at the dead brick and felt anger surge, hot and irrational.

He picked up the charger adapter. The prongs were discolored now, a brown smudge where they'd overheated. He told himself it was cosmetic. He told himself Apple overbuilt their power supplies. He told himself the surges were over.

He touched the outlet plate with the back of his knuckles. A faint tingle ran through his skin, a vibration like a cell phone on silent. He pulled back. The tingle lingered.

"Static," he said again. The word was getting tired.

He took a breath and pushed the adapter into the outlet. The click was louder than before. The green light on the charger flared, then steadied. The fluorescent light buzzed in sympathy. A small blue flash flickered inside the outlet, so quick he might have imagined it.

He stared at it, heart racing. He could stop now. He could pull it out. He could leave. He could send the two pages in the morning and hope Jonah didn't forget him. He could do the smart thing for once.

He didn't.

He plugged in the laptop. The battery icon jumped from red to charging. He felt a rush of relief like a drug. He opened the deck, cut it down, saved a new file. His fingers moved fast, his brain in the narrow tunnel of task completion.

The rain slammed the roof. The light flickered. The outlet hummed.

He could feel the water on the floor warming again, an unnatural heat that had no reason to be there. He shifted his stance and the puddle sloshed against his shoes. He told himself he was on rubber soles, that he was insulated, that he had control. He told himself a lot.

When the two-page deck was ready, he attached it to an email and hit send. The progress bar crawled, then stalled, then crawled again. He watched it like he could force it with his eyes.

The light flickered. The WiFi bars dipped. The progress bar froze at ninety percent.

"Come on," he whispered.

The outlet crackled. He heard a faint pop inside the wall, like a small bubble bursting. He froze.

He could feel the hum in the wall deepen, a vibration that seemed to go through the tile into his shoes. The water on the floor rippled. The smell of ozone thickened, a metallic bite at the back of his throat.

He glanced down and saw the puddle had spread, connecting the drain to the base of the sink. He was standing in it now, his shoes half-submerged. He hadn't noticed the water rise, but it had, silent and patient.

The progress bar moved. Ninety-two. Ninety-three. It was going to send. He needed to hold on for another few seconds. He could do that.

The bathroom light dimmed, then flared. The outlet crackled again. A thin thread of smoke curled up from the plug.

He should have unplugged. He should have stepped back. He should have done anything except keep his hands on the laptop.

He kept his hands on the laptop.

The email sent with a soft whoosh.

He exhaled. Relief spread through him, a warm wash that made his legs feel weak. He reached for the charger plug, ready to pull it out and leave. His fingers hovered. The hum in the wall deepened.

The power in the building shifted. He could feel it before he saw it, a sudden change in the air pressure, the way the light buzzed in a different pitch. Somewhere in the hostel, a refrigerator clicked. Somewhere outside, a transformer groaned.

He remembered Bee. He remembered Ruth. He remembered his mother's dream. He remembered the dead woman on the street over.

He looked at the puddle around his feet, the outlet in the wall, the crack in the plate, the thin blue flash he'd seen before. He felt the tingle in his fingertips as if the current was already testing him.

"Just get out," he told himself. "Just unplug and go."

He reached for the plug.

His phone buzzed on the sink. Another message from Jonah: "Thanks. Will forward."

The surge hit.

The light flared, the outlet cracked, and the floor seemed to breathe. The puddle trembled. The hum in the wall rose into a low, insistent note.

Marcus froze with his fingers a centimeter from the plug and did the calculation that had become his religion: If he moved too fast, he might get shocked. If he waited, the surge might pass. If he left the laptop charging, it might stabilize.

He chose to wait.

Outside the bathroom door, the hallway lights flickered. The rain hammered the building. The monsoon pressed its wet hands against the walls.

Inside the bathroom, Marcus stood in the water with the charger humming and the air tasting like pennies, and told himself, one more time, that he was in control.

He wasn't.
