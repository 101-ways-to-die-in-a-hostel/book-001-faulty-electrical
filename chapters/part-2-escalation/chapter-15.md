# Chapter 15: Flashover

The spark was so small it felt like a dare.

It blinked inside the outlet, a blue punctuation mark, and Marcus froze with the adapter hovering a breath away from the wall. The puddle was still around his ankles, black and patient. The bathroom light buzzed like a tired insect. The laptop screen glowed the only clean light in the room, a little rectangle of false certainty.

He could feel the building humming through the soles of his shoes, a low vibration that made his teeth feel slightly too large for his mouth. Outside the bathroom, the hostel was asleep in the way only a party hostel sleeps: half the building was quiet, the other half was a low murmur of drunk whispers and street noise leaking through the walls. Somewhere in the hallway, a gecko clicked. The sound was sharp, like a nail tapping glass.

He told himself the spark was nothing. He had seen sparks before. At airports, at coffee shops, at his parents' house when his dad plugged in a too-old vacuum and joked about Silicon Valley optimism. Sparks were just energy misbehaving, and everything misbehaved before you optimized it.

He pushed the adapter into the outlet.

The hum rose. The light stuttered once, and his vision narrowed as if someone had dimmed the edges of the world. The water around his ankles warmed in a sudden, thin rush. For half a second his legs were not his legs. They were locked, a muscle decision made without his consent. The laptop's fans jumped to life like a startled animal. His fingers tightened on the cord.

Then it passed. He inhaled sharply and realized he had been holding his breath.

"Okay," he said out loud, and it sounded like a punchline.

The charger brick's tiny light blinked from red to green. His phone vibrated in his pocket, the faintest life. He pulled it out and watched the screen flare awake at one percent. The battery icon was a single red sliver. He grinned despite himself, the way you grin when a slot machine finally spits out a coin.

The smell hit a beat later. Ozone, sharp and clean at first, then the uglier note underneath it: melting plastic, burnt hair, something like overcooked shrimp. He looked down and saw a small curl of steam rise from where the charging cable met the puddle. The cable didn't look damaged, but the air felt wrong, thick and electrical, as if the room had filled with invisible pins.

He yanked the adapter out. The light steadied. The hum dropped back to a low, resentful buzz. The tingle in his calves faded, leaving a faint numbness as if he'd been standing in cold water too long.

He stepped back and almost slipped. The tiles were slick, a film of water over bleach over years of feet. He caught himself on the sink, leaving a wet palm print on the porcelain. His heart was hammering in a way he usually only noticed after caffeine or a pitch.

One percent. Two. The phone crawled upward, glowing with a stubborn little pulse. He opened his inbox with hands that weren't quite steady and saw a single new email.

From: Priya Patel
Subject: Quick Sync Tonight?

"Can you jump on a quick call at 11:30 PM your time? Need to see real usage in real time. Screen share if possible."

He stared at the words until they blurred. Screen share. Real time. Tonight. The universe, or maybe just Priya, had an impeccable sense of timing.

He typed back immediately.

"Absolutely. Will send logs ahead of time and screen share."

He hit send and watched the little arrow spin. The WiFi bars dropped to two. The spinning circle hung for a long, humiliating second. He held his breath like the email was a hostage. Then it went through.

He shoved the phone into his pocket and closed the laptop. The battery was at nine percent. His own felt lower.

When he stepped out into the hallway, the air felt dry by comparison, even though it wasn't. The sign on the door hung at an angle now, the tape losing its grip. DANGER still glared in thick black marker. He closed the bathroom door gently, like closing a lid.

On the stairs, he paused and listened. The power was back on in the hallway, but it flickered, impatient. A faint sizzle came from behind the bathroom wall, like a match burning out of sight.

He climbed to the third floor and slid into his bunk. The dorm was a tangle of limbs and low snores. Someone had left a window cracked; rain breathed in and out of the room. Marcus lay on his back and watched the ceiling stain slowly darken as the leak widened. The night smelled like wet concrete and stale beer.

He set an alarm for 10:45 PM. He would need to be ready. He would need power. He would need a signal. He would need to make reality look good enough to sell.

He closed his eyes, but the hum stayed with him, a phantom vibration at the base of his skull.

---

Morning arrived with the hiss of rain on the awning and the clang of a beer bottle rolling across tile. Marcus woke to the sound of someone vomiting in a bucket and someone else laughing about it. His phone was at three percent. He watched it drop to two while he brushed his teeth at the sink, the water lukewarm and metallic.

He tried the outlet by his bunk anyway. The charger light blinked once and died. The socket gave a soft click, like a tongue tutting. He jiggled the plug, then jiggled the socket itself, the plastic warm and loose under his fingers. The room smelled faintly of burnt dust, and he realized the outlet had a warm halo around it, a heat he could feel through the plate. He withdrew his hand as if the wall might bite.

"You’re still trying to make that work?" Elise asked from the bunk across, her hair wrapped in a towel like a turban. She was scrolling through her phone with the kind of casual doom that came with being twenty-two and already jaded. "That plug is cursed. It made my straightener smoke yesterday."

"It’s not cursed," he said. "It’s just inefficient."

She snorted. "Sure. So is everyone in this room, but we’re still alive."

He wanted to argue with the logic, to point out that efficiency wasn’t the same as safety, but the words tangled. He was too tired to correct a metaphor. He was too tired to admit she’d made a decent point.

Elise hopped down and flicked her wet hair back. "You going to that waterfall tour?" she asked.

"I have a call," he said.

"Always a call." She grinned, not unkind. "Just don’t take it in the murder bathroom."

He laughed because the room laughed. A guy in a Chang tank top made a finger-gun gesture at the hallway. "Live from the danger zone," he said, and everyone laughed again. The joke was a release valve. Marcus could feel the pressure in him hiss out for a moment, just long enough to breathe.

In the common room, the WiFi blinked in and out like a bored conscience. The router's green light pulsed, weak but stubborn. Marcus set up at a corner table with his laptop, a lukewarm coffee, and a grin that fooled no one. He needed to pull live usage data before the 11:30 call. He needed something more convincing than the screenshots he'd already sent.

He opened the backend. The page loaded halfway and froze. He refreshed. Connection timed out. He refreshed again. Nothing. The graph he needed to show was there, but it was a demo graph, all smooth curves and fake momentum. He felt sweat gather at the base of his neck in the already-hot room.

Around him, the hostel woke in its specific way. A British couple argued about whether to go to Ayutthaya or just sleep. A Dutch backpacker with a bleached mustache played ukulele chords that never resolved. Bee sat behind the desk, her coffee untouched, her face a smooth mask of fatigue.

"No WiFi again?" Marcus asked her, because he needed to say something to keep from yelling at the router.

Bee shrugged. "It is there. It is not there." She tapped her phone. "Even my phone." She made a flat wave in the air, the international gesture for unreliable.

The front door banged open. A woman from the second floor swept in, water dripping from her hair. "I got shocked again," she announced, like she was ordering a coffee. She held up her wrist. A small red mark shimmered on the skin.

Bee's eyes flicked to Marcus, then to the woman. "Which shower?"

"The middle one." The woman flopped onto the couch, wetting the cushion. "Maybe I'm just electric."

Marcus laughed, because everyone else did, and because the alternative was too close to screaming. The joke was too easy: the hostel was actually electric. Everyone laughed like it was a metaphor and not a warning.

Bee handed the woman a towel with a resigned motion. "No shower. No charge. No fun," she said, and went back to her phone.

Marcus's laptop beeped. The battery had fallen to eight percent. He watched the number and felt his pulse answer it. His eyes slid, almost on their own, toward the hallway that led to the bathroom.

He stood up quickly, as if walking away from the router would give it space to improve. He moved toward the travel tips board, then the hallway. The bathroom door sat closed, the red tape now dangling by a single strip. The sign's English had smudged from the humidity; DANGER looked like it had been written with a pen that was running out of ink.

He stopped two feet from the door. He didn't go in. He just stood there and listened.

Water shifted inside, a faint slosh. The fan Bee's boss had brought yesterday was still pointed at the door, its blades clogged with lint. It hummed uselessly, pushing wet air in a lazy circle. The wall beside the bathroom was cold to the touch, as if it were holding on to the rain.

He imagined Priya waiting in a clean conference room. He imagined her seeing his screen freeze mid-share, the awkward pause, the polite smile that meant no. He imagined himself explaining Thai WiFi to a woman who had not once had to stand in a puddle to send an email.

He backed away. Not yet, he told himself. Later. Just later.

He went back to the common room and forced a fresh load of the backend. It crawled. It loaded one list of users. All of them were test accounts. He closed the tab and opened LinkedIn, because that was what he did when he wanted to feel like something was moving. The feed was full of people in offices, people at conferences, people posting about "resilience" from desks that never flooded.

His phone buzzed. A text from his sister, Lina.

"Mom asked if you're okay. You haven't replied in a week. Please call her. Please call me."

He stared at the text until the words went soft. He could picture Lina in her tiny apartment in Oakland, her hair in a bun, the way she chewed her lip when she was worried. He could picture his mother's kitchen, the faucet that had a water filter built in, the outlets with little plastic covers when he was a kid. He could picture all the small protections he'd outgrown without noticing.

He didn't reply. He opened his inbox again instead.

At noon, a thunderstorm rolled in with the force of a closing door. The lights flickered twice and held. The air thickened. The hostel became a sponge, soaking up sound and heat. Marcus left the common room and sat in the stairwell, where at least there was a breeze. He opened his laptop on his knees and tried to tether to his phone. The battery icon was now a smudged warning. He needed power. He needed a signal. He needed to stop pretending that time would give him both.

He thought about calling his mother anyway. He even held the phone to his ear and listened to the first ring before hanging up. He could not afford to hear her voice right now, not with the call that mattered later, not with the story he was still selling himself. He sent Lina a three-word text instead: "Busy. Will call." It was the kind of message he had trained himself to write, the executive summary of avoidance.

He checked the time. Twelve forty. He opened his calendar and scrolled to tonight’s meeting, rereading the invite like it might change. Screen share. Real usage. The words sat in his chest like a weight. He felt a small, childish fear that he would join the call and his screen would freeze and Priya would watch him fail in real time. He imagined the silence in the video window, the patience curdling. He imagined her typing a short, polite email the next day: "Let's revisit when you have traction." He imagined his own reply, the false optimism, the apology wrapped in hustle.

His laptop chimed, a low warning. Six percent. He closed it and watched his reflection in the dark screen. His face looked like it had been rubbed with a damp rag. The blue-light glasses sat crooked on his nose. He pushed them up and felt the Whoop band buzz on his wrist, a notification about sleep debt. He deleted it without reading. There wasn't enough battery for guilt.

From the stairwell, he could hear the city breathing. The tuk-tuks, the vendors, the wet tires. He could hear a monk chanting down the block, the sound thin and persistent through the rain. He wondered what that kind of faith felt like, the kind that didn't require a hotspot.

He went down to the street. The rain was warm and heavy, the kind that soaked through fabric in seconds. He walked to the closest 7-Eleven, the air-conditioning hitting him like a slap of clean cold. He bought a bottle of water he didn't want and asked the cashier if he could use the outlet by the microwave. The cashier shrugged, a smaller version of Bee's shrug. Marcus plugged in his phone and watched it climb to eight percent while he stood under the humming fluorescent lights and tried to pretend he wasn't hiding.

Two British teenagers stared at him. One whispered, loud enough for him to hear, "That guy has the vibe of LinkedIn in human form." The other laughed. Marcus smiled at them in a way he had learned at demo days: friendly, unstoppable, slightly too intense. They looked away, bored.

He left with his phone at twelve percent. It wasn't enough, but it was a start. He walked back through the rain, the water filling his shoes, the city smelling of hot asphalt and diesel. Khao San Road was already waking up, vendors setting up carts, a monk standing in the doorway of a temple with rain streaking down his orange robe like a sash of neon.

Back at the hostel, the front desk phone rang and rang before Bee picked it up. She listened, nodded, and hung up with a sigh that felt like a curtain closing.

"Electricity man not come," she said to no one in particular. "He say too much rain. Tomorrow. Always tomorrow." She gave Marcus a look that was equal parts apology and warning. "Maybe you charge upstairs. Not bathroom."

Marcus thought about the outlet in his dorm that had died last night. He thought about the black ring around the socket. He thought about the smell of hot plastic. He thought about the tiny green light on his charger blinking once and then going dark. He thought about the business advice he used to give: If the system isn't built for you, build a new system. He didn't have time to build a new system.

By late afternoon, the WiFi died completely. The router's green light went dark, then red, then dark again. Someone smacked it like it was a vending machine. Someone else laughed and said, "Just reset it," and Bee snapped, "Do not touch." Her voice carried a harder edge than usual, a crack of warning. Everyone pulled back.

Marcus climbed to the rooftop anyway, laptop under his arm, because the roof had been a good place once. The rain had stopped for the moment, leaving the air thick and bright. The city hummed below, a thousand little circuits doing their own math. The rooftop chairs were wet, the string lights sagging, but he sat down and opened his laptop. The WiFi appeared for a breath and then vanished.

He stared at the empty network list. He felt, for a moment, the urge to throw the laptop off the roof and watch it burst on the street below. He imagined the comments. He imagined the post. "Founder has public breakdown in Bangkok." He imagined the DM from a journalist offering him five hundred dollars for a quote. He almost smiled.

A flicker of lightning stitched the sky in the distance, pale and quick. For a second, the tangle of electrical wires along the street below lit up in sharp relief, a black net pulled taut between poles. The wires sagged and swayed, rainwater dripping off them in tiny ropes. Marcus could almost hear the current in them, that faint buzz he'd been pretending not to hear inside the hostel. Bangkok felt like a giant, wet circuit board, all of it exposed, all of it humming.

He pulled up @HostelReaper without thinking. The latest post was a photo of a travel adapter on a wet tile floor, a tiny curl of smoke caught mid-rise. The caption read: "Some outlets are more welcoming than others. #StayCharged." The comments were a mix of laughing emojis and people tagging friends. He scrolled down and saw an older post from a week ago, a blurry shot of a cracked wall plate with the words NO CHARGING scrawled in blue marker. "If you know, you know," the caption said. He stared at it longer than he meant to, the way you stare at a horoscope that gets one detail exactly right.

He closed the app. The wind picked up, cool against his damp shirt. He tried to convince himself he was still in control of the narrative, that he could spin even this into a parable about grit and adversity. But the wires below looked less like metaphors and more like the only reality that mattered.

His phone buzzed. A calendar reminder: "Call with Priya - 11:30 PM." He looked at the time. 5:12 PM. Six hours and change. His stomach tightened. He could feel the call like a distant electric fence.

He went back down. He tried the common room again. No signal. He tried the hallway. No signal. He tried the stairwell. One bar, then zero. He tried the dorm, the window, the rooftop again. Nothing.

At 8:00 PM, the power cut out. The building exhaled into darkness. A chorus of groans rippled through the rooms. The emergency lights clicked on, green and dim. The fan in the dorm slowed to a stop with a sigh. Marcus sat on his bunk and watched the minutes pass, the phone in his hand like a ticking device. Eleven percent. Ten. Nine.

Down the hall, someone lit a candle and started playing guitar, the kind of gentle strumming people used to pretend a blackout was romantic. A voice sang off-key and then laughed. Another voice snapped back, irritated, and the laughter died. The hostel shifted in the dark, bodies adjusting to heat and boredom. The air felt thicker without the fans, a wet blanket laid over every surface. Marcus could smell sweat, damp sheets, the cheap lemongrass cleaner that never quite conquered the mildew. He could also smell something sharper, a faint burned-sugar scent that he couldn't place until he realized it was the lingering hint of ozone from downstairs.

He checked the time again. 9:07. The power hadn't returned. He counted the minutes and watched the battery drain. Each percentage felt like a bead sliding down a wire toward a spark.

He stood up. He picked up his laptop. He walked down the stairs.

The hallway was lit by the emergency glow, the floor tiles reflecting a sick green. The bathroom door waited, the red tape now hanging in a wet curl. The sign looked more like a suggestion than a rule.

He stopped, hand on the door, and listened. The building was quiet. The rain had started again, soft at first and then heavier, like a crowd gathering. He could hear the water in the bathroom, the soft lap of it against tile. He could smell the ozone even before he opened the door.

He stepped inside.

The puddle was higher than before, a shallow sheet that reached past the ankles of his shoes. The fluorescent bulb flickered to life and then dimmed. His laptop screen lit his hands, pale and slightly shaking. The outlet plate glowed in the dim light, a dark square with a crack running through it like a vein.

He set the laptop on the sink, opened it, and watched the WiFi bars climb to three. Relief hit him with the force of a drug. He tethered his phone. The battery ticked down, then paused, then ticked again.

He didn't plug anything in. Not yet. He was just going to join the call. He would start the call, then decide. He would open the backend and screen share without charging, maybe. He could make it work if he was quick. He could optimize on the fly. He could manage a little chaos.

The call was scheduled for 11:30. It was 10:52.

He opened the backend. The page loaded. Real users appeared, or at least the logs did, a small list of names he'd never met, little time stamps that proved life. It was more than he'd had that morning. He took a screenshot anyway, just in case. He opened a second tab and pulled up the demo dashboard. He dragged the window so it covered the fake graph. He practiced clicking between the tabs, a quick, smooth motion that would look real enough on a screen share if no one looked too hard.

His phone vibrated. The battery was at eight percent. The tether was draining it faster than he'd hoped. He turned down the screen brightness. He closed every app except the call software. The percentage kept falling. Seven. Six.

He stared at the charger cable in his bag.

He told himself: just a minute. Just to stabilize the phone. Just long enough to get through the call. It wasn't like he was charging for hours. It wasn't like he was camping there. It was just a quick top-up, a small, calculated risk. He could handle a small risk. He handled them every day.

He reached for the adapter.

The hum in the wall deepened. A tiny blue flash sparked inside the outlet, the same small dare as before. He held the adapter in the air and watched the spark blink out.

Outside the bathroom, the hostel groaned. A door slammed. Someone laughed in the hallway. The rain on the roof became a steady drum.

Marcus looked at his phone. Five percent.

He looked at the outlet. The crack in the plate seemed to widen, or maybe his eyes were doing that thing they did when he stared at something too long. A bead of water slid down the wall and disappeared behind the plate. The smell of ozone sharpened, clean and metallic. His tongue tasted copper.

He whispered, "Just a minute," like it was a prayer.

He pushed the adapter toward the outlet.
