# Chapter 19: Trip Point

The blackout arrived like a notification he couldn't swipe away.

It started with the fan stuttering above his bunk, the blades slowing mid-rotation as if someone had grabbed them with a wet hand. The fluorescent light in the dorm blinked once, twice, then went out completely. In the sudden dark, his phone screen looked obscene, a bright little rectangle that turned every face into a ghost.

Marcus sat up and watched the room go from night to something older. Someone groaned. Someone laughed. A British guy across the aisle said, "Uh, hello?" like the building might answer. The hum of the hostel didn't stop, exactly, but it shifted, a low electric moan that made the air feel thicker.

His phone buzzed in his palm. Forty-two percent. Not enough. Never enough.

He tapped the screen anyway, a reflex. A push notification from LinkedIn: "3 people viewed your profile." He nearly laughed. Of course they did. The light had died, and still the machine was counting him.

On the landing, a phone flashlight flared on. Another. The dorm became a constellation of screens, each person lit by their own private daylight. Marcus stood, the mattress squeaking under his weight, and felt the damp sheets tug at his legs. The heat held in the room like a breath someone refused to let go.

Outside, the monsoon pressed against the windows, the sound like a thousand fingertips drumming the glass. He could smell wet concrete and mildew, the hostel's signature perfume. The power didn't come back after a minute. It didn't come back after two.

The phone dipped to forty-one.

He slid out of the bunk and stepped into his Allbirds, which were still slightly wet from yesterday. The soles made a soft, sticky sound on the tile. He shoved his laptop into his bag and slung it over his shoulder. He didn't know where he was going, only that sitting still in the dark felt like failure.

In the hallway, the emergency lights glowed a weak green, just bright enough to make everything look sick. A couple from Sweden stood in the doorway of their dorm, arguing about whether to go to the rooftop. Somewhere down the hall, someone was playing a song on a phone speaker, a tinny pop track swallowed by the rain. Marcus headed for the stairs.

The main floor was a dim aquarium. The reception desk was unlit, Bee sitting behind it with a phone flashlight tucked under her chin, her face lit from below like a campfire story. The glow made her eyes look hollow.

"Power go," she said, not surprised.

"How long?" Marcus asked.

She shrugged. "Maybe ten minutes. Maybe two hours. Depends." She gestured toward the front door, where the rain had turned the street into a moving sheet of brown water. "Too much rain. The line outside..." She made a cutting motion with her hand. "Sometimes it trip. Sometimes it burn. Mai pen rai." She said it without humor.

"This is bad for the WiFi," he said, because that's what his brain latched onto in any crisis.

Bee's eyes flicked up. "No WiFi when no power. You can use phone data." She paused. "Do not charge in bathroom. Power come back, it surge. Very dangerous." Her English was simple, but the warning was clear.

"I'm not—" he started.

She raised an eyebrow. Not angry, not even annoyed. Just tired. "Okay," she said, which meant she didn't believe him and didn't have the energy to argue.

He nodded like he had complied and moved toward the common room. The couch area was a forest of screens, everyone charging off battery and complaining in low, bored voices. The refrigerator hummed in the corner as if trying to wake up. The smell of stale beer and wet shoes mingled with the bleach from last night's mop. Marcus sat at a table and opened his laptop. The screen flashed low-battery red, a tiny warning triangle in the corner.

He had no internet. He had no power. He had forty-one percent on his phone.

He stared at the numbers like they were a countdown.

A minute later, the lights flickered back to life. The fan jerked, then spun. The fluorescent tube buzzed and steadied. The room collectively exhaled. A few people cheered half-heartedly. Marcus felt the jolt in his own chest like a small, electric relief.

In the corner, the fridge made a coughing sound. The TV blinked on to static. The WiFi bars reappeared on his laptop, two, then three, then dropped again.

The wall outlets came alive with a soft click.

He should have stayed where he was. He should have plugged in at a dry table, watched the bars struggle, accepted the slowness. Instead, his mind did its usual optimization: fastest path to maximum signal. He stood, the chair scraping, and looked down the hallway toward the bathroom.

Bee said, "Marcus."

He paused.

"Power come back," she said. "But not stable. You hear? It is not stable. You wait." Her voice was a rope she was trying to throw him.

He managed a smile. "I'll be careful. I just need to upload a file. Five minutes."

She opened her mouth, then closed it. She wasn't his mother. She wasn't his employee. She wasn't paid to save him from himself.

He walked away anyway.

---

The hallway smelled different after a blackout. It was sharper, more metallic, as if the brief loss of power had scrubbed the air and left something raw behind. The emergency lights still glowed, even though the main lights were on now, creating a double-shadow on the walls. The bathroom door was closed. The NO CHARGING sign had fallen entirely and lay face down in the puddle in front of it, the ink bleeding into the water like a slow bruise.

He stepped over the sign and pushed the door open.

The bathroom was brighter than the hallway, the fluorescent light buzzing with renewed energy. The puddle had spread again, wider than yesterday, creeping up toward the toilet. The sink had a thin film of water on it, the faucet dripping in a steady, bored rhythm. The outlet plate looked damp, darker at the edges, the crack in the plastic wider than he remembered. The green light from his charger reflected faintly in the water, though he hadn't even plugged it in yet. That was how quickly his brain projected outcomes.

He set his laptop on the sink. It rocked slightly. He steadied it with one hand, wiped the moisture with his sleeve, and fished the new adapter out of his bag. It looked clean. It felt clean. It was not clean.

He hesitated long enough to hear Bee's voice in his head. Power surge. Not stable. Wait. He could wait. He could go back. He could drink another terrible coffee in the common room and let the upload crawl.

He didn't.

The adapter slid into the outlet with a tiny click. The charger light came on, green, smug, and then flickered. The flicker was subtle, a blink that might have been in his eyes. He told himself it was nothing and plugged his phone in. The battery climbed to forty-three. He plugged in the laptop. The WiFi bars snapped to three.

The file he needed to upload was a pitch deck revision for a potential investor—an angel he'd met once at a coworking space in SoMa, a man named Jonah who had texted, "Saw your update. Can you send the deck again? Might have someone to intro." The text had come in the middle of the blackout. It was either hope or a trap. Marcus treated it like oxygen.

He clicked upload. The progress bar crawled, then stopped, then crawled again. The WiFi bars dipped to two, then three. He waited, eyes on the bar as if watching would make it move faster.

The drip from the shower head hit the puddle: plip. The drain gurgled: glorp. The light buzzed: bzzzt. The bathroom made a playlist of small, ominous sounds.

A faint crackle came from the outlet. He froze, then told himself it was the light ballast. He pulled his hand away from the sink, even though he hadn't been touching it. His fingers tingled anyway, as if the air had a charge.

The upload reached forty percent. He checked his phone. Forty-four. The numbers were rising. He could do this.

Someone knocked on the door. "Hey, you done?" a woman's voice called.

"Two minutes," he said, the phrase now a reflex.

"Every time," she muttered.

He ignored it. He watched the progress bar. He thought about Jonah, about the small possibility of rescue. He imagined the email hitting Jonah's inbox, the deck opening on a crisp screen in a dry office thousands of miles away. He imagined Jonah nodding, forwarding it, saying, "Worth a look." He imagined himself on a call, smiling with a headset, pretending everything was under control.

The light flickered once. The upload paused.

He held his breath. The light steadied. The upload resumed. The number ticked up. Sixty. Sixty-two.

A breeze moved through the bathroom though there was no window, the air shifting when the exhaust fan tried to turn and failed. The smell of ozone was stronger now, mixed with bleach and wet tile. His skin prickled.

He shifted his stance to relieve pressure on his right foot. His heel slid into the puddle. The water was warmer than he expected, almost tepid, like a bath. That made no sense, and his brain, which liked sense, tried to make it: hot day, warm floor, electricity, whatever. He told himself it was fine and kept his foot there anyway.

The upload hit eighty. He glanced at the battery: forty-six. It should have been a win. It felt like a countdown.

The knock came again, harder this time. "Seriously, man."

He swallowed. "Almost done." He didn't turn.

The progress bar hit ninety-five and froze.

He stared. The bars dropped to one. The laptop wheel spun. He felt the wall hum, a low, steady vibration that seemed to come from inside the tiles. He knew, suddenly and clearly, that the building was tired. It had been tired for years. It was tired now.

The upload completed with a ping that was almost cheerful. He felt a rush of relief so sharp it made him dizzy. He yanked the phone cable out first. The outlet snapped, a small blue flash that made him blink. He yanked the laptop cable. Another snap. The light flickered, then steadied.

His hand hovered over the outlet plate. He didn't touch it. He had learned at least that much.

He shoved the cables into his bag and opened the door. The woman in the hallway glared at him, then slipped past with a towel over her shoulder. He stepped aside, the damp air clinging to him, and walked back toward the common room without looking back.

Bee was still at the desk, her phone light off now, the main lights on. She glanced at him, at the wetness around his shoes, and said nothing. The silence felt like a verdict.

---

By late afternoon, the rain had eased into a steady, relentless drip. Khao San Road outside was a maze of puddles and neon reflections. The hostel smelled like damp laundry and hot plastic. Marcus sat on the rooftop with a weak beer and a stronger sense of doom.

He'd come up for air, he told himself. For signal, too—sometimes the WiFi was better on the roof, the router's weak breath reaching up through the stairwell. Mostly, he wanted to be away from the bathroom. He told himself that as if the bathroom were a place, not a pattern.

The rooftop was empty except for Ruth, the woman with the scar. She was in a hammock, smoking, her legs swinging lazily. The fairy lights overhead were off, still wet from rain. The city below was a blur of traffic and tuk-tuk horns, the smell of grilled meat and exhaust rising with the steam.

Marcus sat on a folding chair and opened his laptop. The WiFi bars wavered between one and zero. He closed it again.

"You look like a guy who just fed a bear," Ruth said without looking at him.

"Sent a deck," he said.

"Into the bathroom?" Her voice was flat, a statement not a question.

He didn't answer.

She laughed once, a short puff of smoke. "You know that building is trying to kill you, right?"

"That's dramatic," he said, but he couldn't muster the edge.

"I've been to a lot of hostels," she said. "Most of them are just cheap. Some are bad. That one downstairs has a mood." She flicked ash into a puddle. "The water talks to the wires in there. You can hear it.

"It's a bathroom," he said.

"It's a trap." She swung her legs, the hammock creaking. "I got zapped in Laos. Freak accident. I was fine. But I don't stand in water anymore and call it efficiency." She looked at him then, her eyes sober. "You're smart. It's not the same thing as careful." She exhaled. "You want advice from someone who has been electrocuted in three different countries?"

"You make that sound like a LinkedIn headline," he said.

She smiled, then sobered. "Don't be in that bathroom when the power comes back. They surge. Old wiring, no ground, wet floor. You become the ground." She tapped her foot against the damp concrete. "And stop trusting that adapter. If it felt warm, it's warm because something is wrong." She paused. "Or keep doing it. It's your experiment. Just know the variables don't care about your narrative."

He took a sip of beer. It was warm and tasted like regret. Below them, a motorcycle revved and died. The sky held its grey. He thought about the outlet, about the way it had blinked when the power returned, about the tiny blue flash that felt like a warning from a creature he couldn't see.

"I have to work," he said. It sounded like an apology.

"Everyone has to work," she said. "No one has to die charging a laptop." She said it lightly, but he felt the words land.

He opened his laptop again, if only to do something. The WiFi bar flickered to one, then dropped. He closed it.

On his phone, a new email popped up. Jonah: "Deck received. Will forward." His throat tightened. It wasn't a yes. It wasn't a no. It was something he could hang on to.

He forwarded the email to himself and to Lina, then deleted it from his inbox, a tiny superstition. He stared at the phone, then at the city below. The rain had started again, a soft curtain that blurred the neon. The smell of wet asphalt rose, mixed with incense from a nearby spirit house. A gecko chirped from under the eaves, the sound like a broken smoke alarm.

He checked the battery. Thirty-seven percent. It should have been enough. It felt like nothing.

He left the rooftop as the first heavy drops fell, the stairs slick under his shoes. Halfway down, the lights flickered again. The building shuddered, the way a body shudders when it's cold.

At the reception desk, Bee was on the phone, speaking Thai quickly, her voice sharp and tired. She hung up and looked at him. "Boss say electrician come tomorrow," she said. "But he say before. Maybe he come. Maybe not." She lifted a shoulder. "Rain make everything worse." Her eyes dropped to his bag. "No bathroom tonight. Promise?"

He almost said yes. He almost meant it. He didn't speak instead, which was its own answer.

She looked away.

---

Night arrived early, the kind of monsoon night that eats the light before it can settle. The dorm was a stew of damp heat and restless bodies. Marcus lay on his bunk with his phone on his chest, watching the battery tick down as if it were a heart monitor.

Thirty-six. Thirty-five. Thirty-four.

His laptop sat on the floor, the lid closed, its own battery a red warning he could feel even without looking. He had told himself he wouldn't go to the bathroom tonight. He had told Bee. He had told Ruth. He had told himself a dozen times.

At nine, his phone buzzed with a calendar reminder: "Call - Jonah / Investor Intro." A glitch. A hope. A maybe. He stared at the reminder like it was a dare.

At nine-oh-five, another email from Jonah: "Can't talk now, maybe later tonight?"

Maybe later. The words hung in the air like a hook. Later meant at some point he couldn't predict, which meant he needed his phone to be ready. It meant he needed his laptop up, his pitch in front of him, the WiFi stable. It meant—

He sat up.

The dorm fan wobbled. The light buzzed. Someone snored. The smell of wet socks and cheap detergent pressed against his face.

He checked the battery again. Thirty-three.

He slid out of bed and stood, the floor cool under his feet. He could go to the common room, plug in at the table, wait. The WiFi would be slow, the outlet crowded, but it would be dry. He could go to the cafe, but the rain was a curtain and the streets were wet and he didn't trust his laptop in the downpour. He could wait and risk missing the call. He could go to the bathroom and guarantee signal.

He put on his shoes.

The hallway was quiet, the emergency lights casting green streaks across the tile. The bathroom door was closed. The sign lay in a crumpled wet heap in front of it. The puddle in the hallway had grown, a thin stream running from the bathroom door toward the stairs.

He stepped over it.

Inside, the air was warmer, heavy with steam. The light buzzed, flickered once, steadied. The puddle was bigger now, the water pooled around the toilet base, a shallow lake that lapped at the sink's shadow. The outlet plate looked glossy, damp like skin after rain. The crack in it was dark, the wiring inside a thin copper glint.

He set his laptop on the sink, wiped the surface with his sleeve, and exhaled. He could still walk away. He could still leave. He could still tell Jonah his phone died. He could still be that kind of person.

He wasn't.

He plugged in the adapter. The green light came on. He plugged in his phone. The battery climbed to thirty-four. He plugged in the laptop. The WiFi bars snapped to three.

He watched the numbers like a hawk. He opened the pitch deck. He opened his email. He opened his calendar. He opened a browser tab and kept it on the inbox, as if visibility could force a message to arrive.

The rain hammered the roof. The fluorescent light buzzed. The puddle warmed. The outlet hummed with a low, steady tone that felt less like sound and more like pressure.

His phone buzzed. A message from Lina: "Please call Mom tomorrow. She cried."

He stared at it. He typed, "I will," and sent it before he could think about what it meant. The battery ticked to thirty-five.

The light flickered. He froze. It steadied again. He exhaled, a slow, controlled breath that didn't feel controlled at all.

The phone buzzed again. An unknown number. He swallowed and answered.

"Marcus?" It wasn't Jonah. It was Alan. The creditor. The voice that knew his real balance.

"Alan," he said, and tried to smile though no one could see it.

"It's Thursday where I am," Alan said. "It's almost Friday for you. I need that payment schedule. I need something.

"I'm on it," Marcus said. He gripped the phone tighter. The cable pressed against his wrist, warm.

"I don't want promises, Marcus. I want numbers." Alan's voice was calm, which made it worse. "I have a lawyer ready. I don't want to use him, but I will."

Marcus's chest tightened. He stared at the laptop screen, at the open pitch deck that was suddenly useless. He needed to keep Alan on the line. He needed to keep him calm. He needed to keep his own panic out of his voice.

"Give me until Monday," he said. "Jonah said he might intro me tonight. If that happens, I can bridge."

"Maybe isn't money," Alan said. "Your maybe isn't my mortgage."

A buzz ran up Marcus's arm, faint but real. He shifted his stance and felt the water in his shoe, warm now, too warm. He forced himself to keep talking.

"I'll wire something," he said. "Partial. A good-faith payment."

"How much?"

He opened his mouth and nothing came. He didn't have a number. He had forty-three dollars in his account and a credit card near the limit. He stared at the puddle, the way the water trembled in the vibration of the wall.

"I can do two grand," he heard himself say. The lie came out clean, practiced.

"Two grand by Monday," Alan said. "I'll hold you to it."

"Okay," Marcus said. The word felt like swallowing a stone.

The call ended. The line went dead. The bathroom felt smaller, like the air had been sucked out.

He set the phone on the sink and stared at his reflection in the mirror. His face was pale, the blue light from the screen making his skin look translucent. The lenses of his glasses caught the fluorescent glare. He looked like a ghost in a Patagonia vest.

The outlet crackled. A small blue flash popped behind the plate, bright enough to paint his reflection for a split second. He flinched. The light flickered in sympathy, a blink from a tired eye.

He should have unplugged then. He should have left. He didn't. He watched the phone battery climb. Thirty-six. Thirty-seven. He told himself he needed forty, just a buffer. Just in case Jonah called. Just in case.

The water crept further across the floor. It touched the sole of his shoe and then his sock. He felt the cold seep into his toes, then warmth again, a strange, unsettling warmth that made his stomach tighten.

He lifted his foot. The water clung to the fabric and pulled. He set it back down, because shifting seemed worse.

He reached for the charger plug. His fingers hovered. The hum in the wall deepened. The outlet's green light blinked once, twice. The fluorescent tube flickered, the shadows jerking on the wall.

The power outside did something—he couldn't tell what—but the surge arrived in the bathroom like a pulse. The light flared. The charger light went out for a split second and came back brighter. The hum deepened into a low growl that he could feel in his jaw.

He froze, fingers still hovering over the plug. The floor felt alive under his feet. The puddle vibrated, tiny ripples forming without any drip to feed them.

He heard Bee's voice in his head: Power come back, it surge.

He heard Ruth: Don't be in that bathroom when the power comes back.

He was in the bathroom. The power was surging. The outlet was humming like a throat clearing.

He looked at the phone. Thirty-eight.

"Just a little more," he whispered, and hated himself for it.

The light flickered again. The air smelled of ozone and wet tile. The water rose just enough to touch the edge of the puddle by the sink, a small connection of wet to wet. He could feel it around his feet, the way it seemed to pull.

His phone buzzed. A new message from Jonah: "You around?"

His heart jumped. His hand moved toward the phone, toward the keyboard, toward the next choice. The floor under him hummed like a held breath.

He typed, "Yes. Call me." He hit send.

The screen of his laptop dimmed. The light flickered. The outlet crackled.

The bathroom went silent for a fraction of a second, a pause so complete it felt like the world was listening.

Then the power surged again.

Marcus stood in the water with his hand on the plug and his phone buzzing, and for the first time, he understood that all his optimization had led him to a single decision he couldn't iterate out of.

He did not move.
