# Chapter 11: Wet Logic

Marcus woke to the smell of singed plastic and the soft, unhelpful certainty that his phone was dead.

The dorm was already sweating. The fan above him clicked like a cheap metronome, the blades slicing wet air without moving it. The compass-tattoo guy had rolled out of bed and was flossing with a look of grim determination. Someone in the corner was narrating a FaceTime call to a friend back home, the words “so, like, the monsoon is actually crazy” bouncing off metal bunks. Marcus lay there for a long beat, the charger cable coiled on his pillow like a small sleeping snake, and tried to decide if the smell was coming from the adapter or from his imagination.

He lifted the adapter to his nose. The plastic was faintly browned at the edges. There was no obvious scorch mark, no smoke, nothing that could be proof. Still, the smell was there, a thin metallic burn like a penny held too long on a tongue. He turned it over and saw a new line of discoloration near one prong, a faint tan smear that looked like the beginning of a bruise. He rubbed it with his thumb until the skin warmed, until the streak felt less like evidence and more like dirt.

He told himself it was dust. He told himself his nose was overreacting because the walls were wet and his brain was tired. He told himself he had slept on a bunk above a bar and was now going to spend the day somewhere with air conditioning and an outlet that didn’t hum.

His phone didn’t cooperate. It stayed black. He pressed the button, waited, pressed again. Nothing. The laptop had 22 percent, a number that felt like both mercy and insult. He opened it anyway, because that was what he did when he didn’t know what else to do. The WiFi icon blinked once and gave him nothing. He closed the lid and sat there, the blue-light glasses slipping down his nose, feeling the day weigh on him in little increments.

He could go to the cafe Bee had mentioned. He could spend seventy baht on coffee and pretend he was a person with an office. He could call Alan from a stable connection and negotiate the debt like a grown-up. He could call his mother and be honest. He could do a lot of things, and the fact that he could do them didn’t mean he would.

He slid out of bed and padded to the outlet by the window. The adapter slid in too easily and the socket wobbled a fraction, a loose tooth in the wall. A tiny crackle snapped inside the plate, and the light on the brick blinked once before settling. He watched it for a full minute, waiting for the flicker that usually came. It held. The charger warmed under his hand, soft heat like a tiny heartbeat. He decided that was good news, because he needed it to be good news.

The dorm door opened and shut. Elise was gone. The compass-tattoo guy left with a towel around his neck. Marcus stood in the middle of the room, his laptop open but useless, his phone dark. His Whoop band vibrated and flashed LOW RECOVERY like a tiny indictment. He picked up the dead phone and tapped his mother’s name. The screen stayed blank. He put the phone down like it had offended him.

On the way downstairs, the hallway lights stuttered twice, as if the building were clearing its throat. He passed the STAFF ONLY door and felt the low hum seep into his bones. The hum felt louder today, or maybe he had just learned to hear it. He kept walking.

In the common room, Bee sat behind the desk with a cup of instant coffee. The router blinked its single tired green eye. The TV played a cooking show on mute, a chef smiling as if heat and electricity were allies. A new sign had appeared on the wall beside the bathroom door, printed in English and Thai and taped flat with fresh strips of clear tape. DANGER — DO NOT CHARGE ELECTRONICS IN THIS BATHROOM. The words were bold and official, the kind of warning that had been typed by someone who had run out of patience and inked his own frustration into policy.

Marcus stared at the sign longer than he meant to. The paper was clean, the tape new, the message less like a rule and more like a confession.

Bee noticed his gaze. “We put new sign,” she said, as if offering a minor improvement. “Too many people charging. Too dangerous.”

“It’s because of the wiring,” Marcus said. It wasn’t a question.

Bee nodded. “Yes. Old. Wet. Not safe.”

Marcus smiled because he didn’t know how to do anything else in the face of a warning. “I get it. It’s probably just about power load, though. Too many devices. People running hair dryers, space heaters.” He heard himself and knew it sounded like a pitch. He kept going anyway. “You could just move the router to a different circuit.”

Bee’s expression didn’t change. “It’s about people not dying.”

He felt his ears go hot. “Right,” he said. “I won’t.”

Bee looked at him for a full beat, a look that said she did not believe him but was too tired to fight. “Coffee place on Chakrabongse,” she said. “Better WiFi. Better outlet.” Her eyes flicked toward the bathroom door, then back. “You get hurt, police come. Boss angry. Nobody want that.”

“Thanks,” he said, and meant it. He did not move.

The sign sat on the wall between them like a referee.

He told himself he was being responsible by standing there, by acknowledging the sign, by listening to Bee’s warning. He told himself that if he went to the cafe later, that would count as choosing safety. He told himself he could manage this without the bathroom. He watched a sunburned guy with a nose ring pass by, phone in hand, shaking his charger as if it were a rattle.

“My adapter sparked again,” the guy said to no one. He held the plug up. One prong was dark, a little scorched. “Think it’s just humidity?”

Marcus smiled without committing. “Probably. Cheap adapters arc. It happens.” He heard himself and thought of Bee’s face. He looked away.

He walked past the sign anyway, not into the bathroom, just past it, as if proximity didn’t count. He could feel the words DANGER at his back like a sticky note he hadn’t removed.

---

He made it to the cafe by ten and stayed until noon, which in his life counted as discipline. The place was called Byte & Brew, a name that felt like a joke at his expense. The WiFi was fast. The coffee was bitter. The air conditioning hummed with a steady indifference. He ran a speed test just to see a number go up for once: 92 Mbps down, 28 up. He stared at the result like it was a good omen. His phone came back to life at twelve percent, a soft glow that made him feel briefly like a person again.

He opened his email. Nothing from Matt. Nothing from Alan. Lina had sent a simple line: Please call Mom today. The word please was doing more emotional labor than any of his marketing emails.

He hovered over his mother’s name and tried to imagine a version of the call that didn’t end with him asking for money or admitting defeat. The imaginary conversation collapsed every time he reached the part where she asked if he was okay. He pictured her kitchen: the fruit bowl, the clean counters, the window that looked out on a backyard without monsoons. The distance between that room and this one felt like a different kind of voltage.

He opened a draft to Alan instead, because it was easier to be formal than honest.

Alan,

I’m working on a short-term bridge. I can make the interest payment by Friday if we can extend by two weeks.

He stared at the sentence until it felt like a lie. The bridge did not exist. The money did not exist. He deleted the line and typed another.

Alan,

I’m currently in Bangkok finalizing a strategic partnership that should unlock a short-term revenue stream.

He deleted that too. The truth was that he was in Bangkok trying to charge his phone in a bathroom because the WiFi was better there. He knew the truth was unmarketable.

He took another sip of coffee and decided, at the last minute, to call his mother while the signal was strong. He tapped her name. The line rang. Once, twice. A click. Voicemail. He could hear her voicemail greeting, the soft sing-song hello she had recorded years ago and never changed. He opened his mouth, closed it, and then spoke anyway because silence felt worse.

“Hey, Mom. It’s me. I’m okay. Just wanted to check in. I’ll call again soon.”

He hung up and immediately felt like he had dropped something fragile. He was okay was a lie. Call again soon was a promise he had already broken three times. He stared at the phone until the screen dimmed, then set it face down as if that could hide the message from himself.

He left the cafe with a slightly higher battery and a slightly lower bank balance. The walk back to the hostel was a slow swim through humid air. A vendor waved a bundle of adapters at him like a bouquet. “Fast charge, safe!” the man said. Marcus kept walking, because if he stopped he would buy another piece of plastic he didn’t trust. Overhead, the wires sagged in a black tangle. Rainwater dripped from them in lazy drops. A motorbike splashed through a puddle and a small blue flicker snapped where water hit a junction. Marcus watched it, felt his shoulders tighten, and kept walking.

Back at the hostel, the smell of bleach and wet socks hit him like a wall. Bee glanced up when he entered and looked down again, the unspoken acknowledgement of someone who knew he would ignore the new sign if desperation called loud enough. Somchai was wringing out a mop by the courtyard, the bucket water the color of weak tea. The floor near the bathroom already gleamed, the puddle gathering as if it were the only thing in the building that consistently showed up for work.

He went upstairs and plugged his phone into the dorm outlet. The brick light blinked and held. The adapter warmed under his fingers. He sat on the edge of the bunk and watched the battery climb, one percent at a time, like a tiny climbing wall he kept falling off. The outlet made a soft, insect-like buzz that hadn’t been there before. He told himself it was the fan, the phone, the universe, anything except the wall.

By mid-afternoon, the power flickered and the charger light stuttered. He yanked the adapter out before it could get hot. The outlet made a soft crackle as if annoyed. He looked at it the way you look at a colleague you don’t trust but still need. He imagined a GFCI outlet, the kind his parents had in the bathroom at home, a little button that could interrupt danger. The hostel didn’t have that. The hostel barely had a door that locked.

He opened his laptop and tried to work. The WiFi dropped twice in ten minutes. He drafted a revenue plan and deleted it. He opened his bank app and closed it. He refreshed his inbox and felt nothing. He was an algorithm looping through failure conditions.

At three, the rain returned with a hard, impatient burst. The lights flickered. The fan slowed, then resumed. Someone in the hallway shouted about the shower going cold. A backpacker in the common room joked about the power being haunted. Marcus laughed without humor and turned his laptop back on.

He told himself he would not go to the bathroom. He told himself he had a better outlet now, a better plan. He told himself he could ride out the afternoon on thirteen percent and then charge again when the power steadied.

At four thirty, the power cut out entirely. The lights died. The fan stopped. The dorm went quiet, a collective held breath. Marcus watched his laptop battery tick down in the dark. When the power returned, it did so with a sharp, bright surge that made the bulb above his bunk pop like a camera flash. He blinked hard and felt his heart spike. The charger light stayed off. The outlet smelled faintly scorched. Someone in the hallway yelled, “That’s my third charger this week,” and a wave of laughter rolled down the corridor, the kind of laughter that meant nobody knew what else to do.

He closed his laptop and sat there in the dim, feeling the warning deepen into a dull ache. The new sign downstairs, Bee’s flat warning, the flickering light, the tiny flash on the street. They were all the same message in different fonts.

He told himself he needed to make the interest payment by Friday. He told himself he needed to call Alan. He told himself he needed a better signal. He told himself the bathroom outlet was just like any other outlet if you were careful, if you kept your hands dry, if you didn’t touch the water, if you balanced on your toes and didn’t think about the way water carried current with the efficiency of truth.

He went up to the rooftop to get air and, maybe, a bar or two of signal. The stairwell smelled of wet concrete and old teak. The roof was slick, the plastic chairs upturned like turtles waiting for the rain to flip them back. The string of fairy lights sagged in a lazy arc, half of them dead, half of them pulsing faintly as if embarrassed.

Ruth was there, of course, perched on the edge of a chair with her cigarette angled down so it wouldn’t sog. She looked at him and lifted her eyebrows. “You look like you just tried to negotiate with the outlet again,” she said.

“I didn’t,” he said, which was not entirely true and therefore felt like a confession.

She shrugged. “Power’s getting worse. The shower on the third floor bit me again.” She made a small pinch motion with her fingers. “Not bad. Just a warning nip.”

Marcus leaned on the railing and looked down at Khao San Road. The street was a wet circuit board: neon, wires, puddles. He could see the overhead tangle swaying with the wind, black cables sagging under the rain like veins carrying the city’s pulse. A tuk-tuk splashed through a puddle and a tiny blue spark popped where a wire dipped low. He flinched and pretended he hadn’t.

Ruth watched him. “You have that look,” she said.

“What look?”

“The look of someone who thinks rules are for other people.” She said it without meanness, almost like a diagnosis. “You’re not the first. This place runs on people thinking they’re the exception.”

Marcus wanted to say that he wasn’t reckless, just efficient. He wanted to explain that the outlet was ungrounded but the adapter was double-insulated, that the risk was marginal if he didn’t touch the water. He wanted to run the math out loud, to make it sound like a spreadsheet and not a hunch. He said, “I’m careful,” instead.

Ruth snorted smoke toward the rain. “Careful is what everyone says five minutes before they do something stupid.” She flicked ash into a puddle. “You hear about the German guy here a few years back? Not here-here, different hostel. He was charging in the shower because the WiFi was better. He slipped, got a zap, knocked himself out. Woke up with a scar and a story he tells on every bar crawl. Lucky, sure. But everyone says lucky like it’s a skill.”

Marcus felt the story land, not as fear but as a challenge. He knew he should hear it as a warning. His brain filed it in the same folder as Bee’s sign, Somchai’s tired eyes, the tingling in his feet: evidence that other people were more cautious. He told himself he was different. He told himself he had to be.

“I’m not charging in the shower,” he said, which was true, in the way omissions are true.

Ruth looked at him for a long moment, then shrugged. “Just saying. Electricity doesn’t care about your plans.” She stubbed the cigarette out on the wet concrete. “Also, your phone has one bar. I can see it dying from here.”

He checked. One bar flickered, then died. The phone felt heavier in his hand, as if it were embarrassed. He put it back in his pocket and told himself he would go to the cafe again tomorrow, as if tomorrow weren’t a promise he had already overused.

He went back down the stairs with the rain on his shoulders and the hum of the building in his bones. In the hallway, the light flickered once, a quick, nervous blink. He thought about the sign downstairs. He thought about the way it had been taped flat with care. He thought about the word DANGER. It did not feel like a word for him. It felt like a word for people who didn’t understand their own circuitry.

He picked up the charger.

---

By night, the hostel had filled with the damp, loud energy of people determined to drink away the monsoon. The common room pulsed with bass and bucket cocktails. The air smelled like rum, sweat, and wet concrete. A cluster of Brits had built a charging shrine by the honor-system fridge: two power strips daisy-chained into a third, a mess of white cords and international adapters, the whole stack humming under the load. The lights flickered every time someone plugged in. Marcus moved through the crowd with his laptop held above his head like a tray, feeling ridiculous and fragile.

Bee was at the desk. The new sign by the bathroom looked cleaner than everything else, a fresh sentence in a building full of old problems. Marcus stopped in front of it and read it again.

DANGER — DO NOT CHARGE ELECTRONICS IN THIS BATHROOM.

He told himself: it’s about the load. He told himself: the sign is a liability shield, a way for the owner to say he warned you. He told himself: modern chargers are designed to handle dirty power, that’s literally why they exist. He told himself: this is a two-prong adapter, the current will go through the cable, not through him. He told himself: he would be careful. He told himself: he would only use the WiFi. He told himself: he needed ten percent. He told himself a lot of things.

He stepped past Bee without meeting her eyes. He heard her say his name. He kept walking.

The hallway was slick, the tile still damp from Somchai’s mop. The bathroom door was closed. The new sign made it feel like a forbidden room, and he resented it for that.

He opened the door and stepped inside.

The room was a humid box of light and water. The puddle covered the entire floor now, a shallow sheet that reached the door and glimmered under the fluorescent buzz. The smell was stronger tonight: bleach, mildew, and the sharp metallic edge of ozone, like a storm trapped behind the wall. The outlet plate was cracked wider than before. The corroded wire behind it looked like a vein near the surface of skin. The drain in the center gurgled once, then stopped, as if it had decided to let the water win.

He set his laptop on the sink and opened it. Two bars of WiFi. The inbox was empty. The cursor blinked like a taunt.

His phone battery was at eight percent. He watched the number and felt the old calculation start. Eight percent could maybe get him a call if the line didn’t drop. Ten would be safer. Eleven would be enough to take a call from Alan without watching the battery die mid-sentence.

He pulled the charger out of his bag. The adapter felt warm in his palm, as if it remembered where it was going. He hesitated. The new sign on the door was in his peripheral vision, a white square of bold text. He forced himself to look away. He told himself that if he kept his feet still and his hands dry, the circuit wouldn’t include him. He told himself that was how circuits worked, because he had once built a gaming PC and therefore understood electricity at a first-principles level.

He plugged the adapter in.

A small blue flash winked behind the plate. The light flickered. The charger glowed green. The hum returned, thin and hungry. He felt it in his teeth.

He connected his phone to the laptop and watched the battery climb to nine percent. The water around his feet was cool and slick. A faint tingle started in his toes, the same fizzing sensation he had begun to treat as normal. He shifted his weight. The tingle stayed. He lifted his toes, standing on the balls of his feet, as if that changed the physics. The water slid around his arches anyway.

He opened a draft to Alan and typed:

I can pay the interest on Friday, but I need a two-week extension.

He stared at the sentence and wondered if it was a lie or a spell. He didn’t send it.

The rain outside intensified, a hard drumming on tin. The light flickered again, a longer stutter. The outlet crackled once, a dry snap from inside the wall. He swallowed. The tingle in his feet crept up his arches. He felt his grip on the laptop tighten, his fingers curling around the edge as if the machine could anchor him to safety.

Ten percent.

He reached for the cord. The hum rose into a higher pitch. The water around his ankles shivered as if the floor had exhaled. He froze with his hand hovering over the cable, his breath shallow.

The sign on the door sat in his peripheral vision like a judge. Bee’s voice echoed in his head: You can die. Somchai’s tired eyes floated up in his memory. His father’s voice, years ago: Electricity isn’t forgiving.

He told himself: one more percent. Just to be safe. Just to make the call. Just so the battery doesn’t drop mid-sentence again.

Eleven percent.

He yanked the adapter out. The charger light died. The hum faded. The bathroom light steadied. He stood there for a beat, breathing hard, the tingle fading from his feet like a retreating tide.

He tucked the phone into his pocket and lifted the laptop off the sink. A bead of water rolled off the underside and splashed onto his wrist. He flinched.

He stepped out into the hallway and found Bee at the desk, eyes on him. She said nothing. He said nothing. The silence between them was a warning that had run out of words.

Upstairs, he sat on his bunk and tried to call Alan. The call rang once, then dropped. He stared at the dead screen until the battery slid back to ten percent. He opened his mother’s contact instead. Voicemail again. He left another message, voice too cheerful, words too small. “Hey, Mom. It’s me. I’m okay. I’ll call soon. I love you.” He hung up and felt the familiar hollow settle behind his ribs.

He lay back and stared at the ceiling stain. It had grown again, a slow bloom of damp that didn’t care about his plans. He closed his eyes and listened to the hostel hum, the wires in the walls carrying current like an old heartbeat.

Downstairs, the ground-floor bathroom light flickered once. The outlet hummed quietly to itself. The puddle gathered, thin and patient, waiting for the next time someone needed one more percent.
