# Chapter 12: Residual Current

The email arrived at 9:02 AM like a bird hitting a window.

SUBJECT: Immediate Call Required — Today

It was from Alan, the lender who charged interest the way monsoons charged the air: heavy, unrelenting, and full of static. The words were short and clean, which meant they were sharp. Marcus stared at the screen in the dim dorm light and felt a thin line of cold run down his spine, the kind that arrives before a bad pitch or a bad diagnosis.

The dorm was a damp aquarium. A girl on the top bunk whispered to her boyfriend in French, the consonants soft and intimate. Someone’s phone alarm went off and was slapped into silence. Marcus read the email again as if repeated exposure could make it kinder.

Immediate Call Required — Today.

Today meant not tomorrow, not “after I find better WiFi,” not “after I get a battery to fifteen percent.” Today meant right now, which in his world meant right now in the only place with a signal strong enough to carry a conversation, the place he had promised himself he was done with.

He sat up and looked at his phone. Twelve percent. The battery icon was the size of a thumbnail but it felt like it had a pulse. He checked the WiFi in the dorm. One bar, then none. The router in the common room would be slightly better, but the moment more than three people opened TikTok the signal would turn into vapor. The cafe was an option, but it cost money he had already spent in his head.

He opened the banking app, just to see if anything had changed in the last eight hours. It had not.

He closed the app and looked at the email again. His mind started to run the familiar calculus: battery percentage minus time to the cafe plus cost of coffee plus opportunity cost of walking there plus chance the cafe was flooded plus chance Alan was the kind of person who called once and then decided you were dead to him.

The calculation ended where it always did now, at the ground-floor bathroom.

He slid off the bunk, grabbed his laptop, and felt the charger cable like a guilty thing in his hand. He told himself: I will use the WiFi only. He told himself: I will not plug in. He told himself: I will stand on dry tile, just inside the doorway, the way people stand outside a haunted house to prove they don’t believe in ghosts.

He walked downstairs.

The hostel was half awake, half hungover. The common room smelled of stale rum and fresh bleach. Bee was behind the desk, hair pulled back, eyes heavy but alert. She looked up, saw the laptop under his arm, and a faint flicker passed over her expression.

“Morning,” he said.

She nodded. “Coffee?”

“Later,” he said, which meant never.

He paused near the bathroom door. The sign was there, larger, bold, newly laminated like a diploma nobody wanted to earn. DANGER — DO NOT CHARGE ELECTRONICS IN THIS BATHROOM. Underneath, someone had written in pen: NO EXCEPTIONS.

He could almost hear the person who wrote it, the tired tone, the last reserves of patience pressed into ink. He looked at Bee. She was watching him in the reflection of her phone screen.

“I just need the WiFi,” he said.

“No,” she said, flat and quick. “Today worse. Rain last night. Water inside wall. No WiFi worth your life.”

He felt the sting of being told no by someone who didn’t answer to him. “I’m not plugging in,” he said, as if the words were protective equipment. “I can stand in the doorway. I just need to get on a call. It’s important.”

Bee held his gaze, and in her eyes he saw the small ledger of people who had said the same thing.

“You promise?” she asked.

He could have said yes. He could have been honest and said, I don’t know. He could have said, I’m scared too. Instead he nodded once, the kind of nod that felt like a signature he intended to renegotiate.

She sighed, a thin sound. “If you get shock, I call ambulance. I do not touch.”

“Fair,” he said, trying to make it a joke. It did not land.

He opened the bathroom door.

The room was dimmer than usual, the fluorescent light flickering like a nervous eye. The floor was wet, the puddle pushed to one side as if it had been forced to make room for a broom. The drain gurgled once, a reluctant throat clearing. The outlet plate seemed more cracked than yesterday, a wider wound. A faint buzzing filled the air, the old hum he had started to hear in his bones.

He stood in the doorway, shoes on, laptop open, and watched the WiFi bars rise to two, then three. The change felt like a small miracle. He clicked the email and hit call, the number connecting through WhatsApp with a moment of static and then Alan’s voice.

“Marcus,” Alan said. His voice was calm in the way surgeons are calm. “We need to talk.”

“I’m here,” Marcus said. He leaned his shoulder into the doorframe, careful not to step into the water. “I’m ready.”

“Good,” Alan said. There was a pause, the kind that meant he was taking a breath to say something that had already been decided. “The payment was due yesterday.”

“It will be Friday,” Marcus said. “I can do Friday. I just need a short extension.”

A thin laugh. “You’ve asked for a short extension four times.”

“It’s not a short extension when the deal closes,” Marcus said, the words coming out of him by habit, like autopilot. “There’s a partnership in motion. It’s a matter of timing.”

Alan didn’t answer immediately. The silence was heavy and full of rain.

“Marcus,” he said. “I’ve been patient. My investors have not. If we don’t receive the payment in full by Friday, we will proceed with collection.”

“Collection,” Marcus said. The word tasted like rust.

“It means legal action. It means court. It means your assets frozen.”

“I don’t have assets,” Marcus said, then wished he hadn’t.

“Your name is an asset,” Alan said. “Your reputation. Your future earnings. We can do this the polite way or the unpleasant way. But we will do it.”

Marcus opened his mouth to argue, to explain, to pitch, but the words wouldn’t line up. His mind ran through the usual slides: traction, TAM, runway. None of them fit in this room. None of them fit in his life.

“Okay,” he said, and the word cracked.

Alan paused. “You sound tired.”

“I’m in Thailand,” Marcus said, as if geography were an excuse. “It’s a different time zone.”

“It’s the same debt,” Alan said. “Listen, I’m not your enemy. But I’m not your friend either. I’m just a timer.”

A small, ridiculous sound came out of Marcus’s throat. He swallowed it. “Friday,” he said. “You’ll have it.”

“We’ll see,” Alan said. “That’s all.”

The call ended with a soft click that sounded too much like a lock.

Marcus stood still, staring at his laptop, the WiFi bars still strong. He could feel his heart thudding against his ribs like a code trying to escape. He swallowed, swallowed again, and realized his eyes were wet. He pressed the heel of his hand into his eye, embarrassed even in an empty bathroom, even alone.

He looked at the water on the floor. It had crept closer to his shoes. The puddle didn’t care about his call. It didn’t care about his debt. It was the same puddle it had been yesterday, only slightly larger.

He took a breath, and then another. He told himself he needed to send a follow-up email, to put his promise into writing. He told himself he needed to check his phone. He told himself a hundred things that were all, essentially, the same: keep moving, don’t sit with this feeling.

He closed the laptop and stepped backward into the hallway. Bee watched him from the desk. He didn’t meet her eyes.

Upstairs, he sat on his bunk, the fan clicking overhead like a metronome. He opened his phone. Twelve percent had fallen to nine during the call. The number felt like a countdown.

He called his mother again. This time she answered.

“Marcus?” Her voice was soft, surprised, cautious, like she was approaching a skittish animal.

“Hi, Mom,” he said. His throat tightened. He heard the kitchen sounds in the background: a faucet, a cupboard closing. It sounded like a life that kept moving without him.

“Are you okay?” she asked, immediate and direct.

He wanted to lie. He wanted to say, yes, I’m fine, I’m busy, I’m doing great. He wanted to protect her from the truth and himself from the shame of saying it. The word that came out was “I’m tired.”

There was a pause. “Do you need help?”

“I just need time,” he said. “I’m figuring it out.”

“Marcus,” she said, and the way she said his name pulled him back to a kitchen in Cupertino, to a boy who had missed dinner because he was trying to fix a computer. “You don’t have to do everything by yourself.”

The sentence was so simple it hurt. He felt his eyes sting again and turned his face away from the dorm, as if the empty bunks could see him. “I know,” he said, and it came out thin.

“Where are you?” she asked.

“Bangkok,” he said.

“Is it safe?”

He thought about the bathroom sign. He thought about the outlet crackle. He thought about the water that wouldn’t drain. “It’s fine,” he said. “It’s just humid.”

She exhaled. “Your sister said you didn’t call back yesterday.”

“I tried,” he said. “The call dropped.”

“I miss you,” she said.

The words landed in him with a quiet thud. He could hear his mother’s refrigerator hum, a steady, reliable electrical sound. He could hear the clink of a spoon in a mug. He could hear the life he had not disrupted.

“I miss you too,” he said, and it was the first true thing he had said in days.

They talked for six minutes. He kept one eye on the battery, which slid from nine to five as if it were draining on the emotion itself. When the phone buzzed the low battery warning, he swallowed his goodbye and said, “I have to run. I’ll call soon. I promise.”

“Promise me you’re taking care of yourself,” she said.

“I am,” he said, which was true in the smallest, most technical sense.

The call ended. He stared at the screen. Four percent. He put the phone down carefully, as if it were a glass he didn’t trust his hands to hold.

A tear made it to his chin before he could wipe it away. He pressed his forehead into his palms and counted his breaths, a strategy he had once tried in meditation and abandoned after three days because it felt unproductive. Now it was the only thing that made sense.

He sat up, wiped his face, and looked at the charger cable. The adapter had a faint brown smudge near one prong, darker than before. He rubbed it with his thumb and felt the plastic warm under his skin.

He told himself he needed to charge his phone before it died. He told himself he should go to the cafe. He told himself he needed to save money. He told himself the outlet in the dorm was unreliable. He told himself a lot of things.

He went downstairs.

The common room had filled with a new set of bodies. The Brits with bucket drinks were gone, replaced by Australians comparing sunburns. The power strip shrine by the fridge had grown: a forest of cords, adapters, and power bricks all feeding into a single wall outlet that looked like it wanted to spit them out. The lights flickered every time someone plugged in.

A guy with a man bun was holding his charger cable up like a dead fish. “This thing just started smoking,” he said. “Is that normal?”

“Depends,” Marcus said, because he did not know how to stop himself. “Sometimes the plastic gets hot, especially with these cheap adapters.”

The man bun guy looked skeptical. “Should I stop using it?”

Marcus opened his mouth to answer. Bee’s voice cut in from behind the desk. “Yes,” she said. “Stop. Unplug.”

The man bun guy complied, sheepish. Marcus felt a flicker of embarrassment on Bee’s behalf, then realized it was on his own. He was always the one trying to reason away the risk. Bee was always the one with the final say. The power dynamic felt upside-down in his chest.

He picked a seat near the router, hoping the signal would be strong enough for a few emails. The WiFi stuttered, then dropped. The router blinked its tired green eye at him. He opened his inbox anyway. No new messages. He refreshed. Nothing.

His phone buzzed once and died. The screen went black.

He stared at it. The battery icon had become a flat line. He set it down and felt a small panic rise like a bubble. The black screen wasn’t just a dead phone; it was a severed lifeline. It meant he couldn’t call Alan back, couldn’t check for a response, couldn’t receive an apology or a miracle.

He stood up and walked toward the bathroom without deciding to.

He reached the door and stopped. The sign stared at him. The pen scrawl NO EXCEPTIONS looked fresh, impatient. He could almost hear Bee’s voice. No charging. Water, old wire. You already get shock. Don’t go again.

He glanced at the cafe across the street through the window, a blue sign, a few people inside, air-conditioning visible in their posture. He imagined the coffee cost. He imagined the walk in the rain. He imagined his bank app showing numbers like a skinned knee.

He opened the door.

The bathroom was empty and wet, the kind of wet that never dries. The puddle had grown again, a thin mirror covering most of the floor. The light flickered as he entered, a fast stutter. He smelled ozone. He set his laptop on the sink and opened it. Two bars. It felt like a cruel joke, like the place had been built just to tempt him.

He plugged in the adapter without looking at the sign.

The outlet snapped, a small blue flash inside the cracked plate. He flinched and froze with his hand on the adapter. The charger light blinked once, then steadied. The hum returned, thin and high. His fingers tingled. He waited, heart pounding, then let out the breath he had been holding.

He connected the phone.

The screen lit up. The battery icon crawled from zero to one. It felt like watching a heartbeat return on a monitor.

He told himself he would get to five percent and leave. He told himself he would stand on dry tile. He told himself he was not touching the water.

His shoes were already wet.

The water was cool around his soles. He shifted, trying to find a dry patch. There wasn’t one. The puddle had reached the door and the wall and everything in between. He felt the faint fizz of current again, a soft tingling at the edge of sensation. He lifted his heel, then set it down. The tingle stayed.

He watched the battery climb: two percent, three. He watched the WiFi bars hold steady. He opened his email to Alan and typed a line: Payment Friday. Confirm receipt. He stared at the line and felt the words tilt toward desperation. He hit send anyway. The email left with a soft whoosh, as if the computer was exhaling for him.

Four percent. He should leave. He didn’t.

A drip fell from the shower head and hit the puddle with a tiny plink. The sound made him jump. He glanced at the outlet. The crack in the wall plate looked darker, the corroded wire behind it almost metallic green. He imagined his parents’ bathroom at home, the clean outlet with a little test button, the way the light in that bathroom never flickered. He imagined his mother’s refrigerator hum, steady and safe.

Five percent. He reached for the cord.

The light flickered hard. The outlet crackled, louder than before, a brittle pop. The charger light flickered in sympathy. He froze, fingers hovering over the plug, feeling the air around him thicken with that electric smell, ozone and hot plastic.

He waited for the power to stabilize. It did, like a predator choosing to sit back down.

He yanked the adapter out. The hum faded. The light steadied. He exhaled. He hadn’t known he was holding his breath.

He stepped backward into the hallway, shoes squeaking on the wet tile, and closed the bathroom door behind him as if it could close out the danger too.

Bee’s chair squeaked as she stood. She was in front of him before he could pretend he hadn’t heard her.

“I told you,” she said. It wasn’t angry. It was exhausted.

“I had to make a call,” he said. He held up the dead phone, as if it were evidence. “It was important.”

“More important than you?” she asked. The question landed with a weight he didn’t know how to carry.

“I didn’t get shocked,” he said, because he didn’t know what else to say.

She looked at his shoes, the wet cuffs of his pants, the charger cable in his hand. “Not yet,” she said.

He wanted to argue. He wanted to say that he was being careful, that he had been in worse situations, that he understood the risks. He wanted to say that she didn’t know what it felt like to be at the edge of ruin. Then he realized she probably did. He shut his mouth.

Bee exhaled. “Boss will fix,” she said, though they both knew it was a lie or a hope or both. “Maybe next week.”

“Next week,” he repeated, as if to anchor himself in time.

She sat down again, her shoulders slumping. “Go to cafe,” she said, softer. “No water there.”

He nodded and walked out into the rain.

---

Byte & Brew was crowded, the air conditioning struggling to keep up with the damp bodies inside. Marcus ordered the cheapest coffee and took a seat near the window. The WiFi was fast. He opened his email and watched the sent message to Alan sit there like a confession.

He refreshed. Nothing.

He opened LinkedIn because it was easier than staring at the empty inbox. A former colleague had posted a picture of a standing desk and a caption about “designing life with intention.” Marcus scrolled past. He opened Twitter and saw a new @HostelReaper post: a close-up of a wall outlet with black scorch marks, captioned, “When the sign says NO, it means the wall is tired of saying please.”

He stared at the post, feeling it point at him without naming him. He closed the app.

He looked out the window at Khao San Road. The rain had turned the street into a shallow river. Motorbikes cut through it, leaving wakes. A vendor held a tarp over a stack of power banks, the cords dangling like wet spaghetti. A man ran with a backpack over his head. The city looked like it was shorting out in slow motion.

He checked his bank app again. The number had not changed. He closed it and opened a document titled PARTNERSHIP PITCH. He typed two lines and deleted them. He had never been good at writing when his body was tired.

His phone buzzed. A reply.

From Alan: “Payment must clear by Friday 5PM PST. No exceptions.”

The words were plain. They were not cruel. They were just a cliff.

Marcus stared at the message and felt the small, ridiculous urge to negotiate with the universe. Friday 5PM PST was Saturday morning in Bangkok. That gave him time. That gave him two days. It was nothing and it was everything.

He opened his calendar and looked at it as if it were a chessboard. Two days. He could find a miracle in two days if he didn’t sleep. He could build a deck, pitch a story, chase a check. He could do what he had always done: believe in the power of a deadline to make reality bend.

He closed the calendar and took a sip of coffee that tasted like metal. His hand shook slightly. He set the cup down and forced himself to breathe.

He sent a text to Lina: Need to borrow $2K. Urgent. Will explain.

He sent another to Matt, the investor who had gone quiet: Can we jump on a quick call? It’s important.

He sent a third to an old college friend he hadn’t spoken to in a year: Hey man, weird ask, but are you still investing in small deals?

He watched the messages send and felt both hopeful and ashamed. His life had become a series of pings.

The cafe lights flickered once. Marcus flinched. No one else noticed.

He stayed until his phone reached thirty percent, then left because he couldn’t justify another coffee. The rain had eased into a drizzle, the air thick and warm. He walked back to the hostel feeling like he was carrying the weight of the city’s wires on his shoulders.

At the entrance, Somchai was mopping again, the puddle at the bathroom door still fighting him. He nodded at Marcus and said, “You go cafe?”

“Yeah,” Marcus said.

Somchai gestured toward the ceiling, toward the hum. “Electricity not good. Today, yesterday. Maybe worse.” He shrugged, a small acceptance. “Be careful.”

“I am,” Marcus said, because it was the only response he had left.

Upstairs, the dorm was empty. The air was stale. He plugged his phone into the outlet by his bunk and watched the charger light flicker, then hold. He sat on the edge of the mattress and tried to work. His laptop battery was at forty percent. The WiFi in the dorm was dead. He tethered to his phone, watching the battery slide as he did.

He opened his email again. Nothing from Lina. Nothing from Matt. Nothing from anyone who could save him.

He opened the pitch deck he had been revising for months. Slide one: a map of Southeast Asia with little dots. Slide two: a graph with an uptrend line he had drawn by hand because Excel felt too honest. Slide three: a vision statement about “unifying the fragmented digital nomad economy.” He stared at the slides and felt them wobble, like a dream you realize you’re having.

He closed the deck and lay back on the bed. The ceiling stain above him had darkened again, a damp halo that looked like a bruise. He watched it until the fan’s clicking started to feel like counting down seconds he couldn’t afford.

His phone buzzed. A text from Lina.

“Marcus. I can do $500. That’s it. Please call me.”

He swallowed. Five hundred wouldn’t cover the interest, but it was a hand reaching out. He started to type a thank you, then deleted it and called her instead.

The line rang. She picked up on the second ring. “Hey,” she said, and the word sounded like a door opening.

“Hey,” he said. “Thanks for texting back.”

“You okay?” she asked. Her voice was tired, and underneath it, a kind of steadiness he had always taken for granted.

“I’m… fine,” he said, because that was his default. Then he said, “Not fine. But I’m working on it.”

She didn’t answer immediately. “You’re in Bangkok, right?”

“Yeah.”

“Why?”

“Cheaper,” he said. “And the WiFi is—” He stopped himself. “It was supposed to be cheaper.”

She exhaled. “Marcus, you don’t have to do this alone.”

He heard his mother’s words again. “I know,” he said.

“I can help,” Lina said. “Not much, but I can help.”

He closed his eyes and let the word help wash over him. It felt like both relief and surrender. “Thank you,” he said, and he meant it.

They talked for ten minutes, about nothing and everything. Lina filled him in on her job, on her dog, on their friend group. He listened and felt the world widen beyond his own shrinking problem. His phone battery slipped from thirty to twenty as they talked. He didn’t care.

When the call ended, the dorm felt quieter, but the quiet didn’t feel as sharp. He stared at his phone, the battery now at nineteen. He considered charging it in the dorm outlet, decided to, and felt the guilt of that decision as if the dorm outlet itself were judging him.

He plugged it in. The charger light blinked. It held. He exhaled.

---

The evening brought the kind of storm that made the building shiver. Rain hammered the roof. The lights flickered twice in the dorm and then steadied. Marcus watched the charger light with a superstition he pretended was rational.

He went downstairs for air and found Bee by the desk, scrolling on her phone. The TV in the common room was showing a Thai soap opera with the sound off. The volume of the rain filled the silence.

“Any word from your boss?” he asked, because he needed to talk to someone who wasn’t his phone.

Bee glanced up. “He says fix after high season,” she said. “Always after.”

“When is high season?”

She shrugged. “Here? Always. Khao San always has people.” She tapped her phone. “He says money tight. He has other buildings.”

Marcus nodded. He understood “money tight.” He understood the logic of postponing repairs when the risk felt abstract. He didn’t like it, but he understood.

Bee looked at him for a second. “You talk to your family?” she asked.

He hesitated. “Yeah,” he said. “A little.”

She nodded, as if that meant something. “Good,” she said. “Sometimes family better than WiFi.”

He laughed, a small sound. “Maybe.”

She stood and stretched. “You hungry? I have noodles.”

“Thanks,” he said. “I might.”

He ate the noodles at a plastic table, the heat of them a small comfort. They tasted like sodium and survival. He listened to the rain and the hum of the lights and tried not to think about the deadline.

At nine, the power flickered again. The lights went out for three seconds and then returned with a bright surge that made the TV pop. The fan in the common room sputtered and resumed. The room sighed in unison. Marcus felt the surge in his chest like a small, involuntary panic.

He checked his phone. Twenty-four percent. He looked at his laptop. Fifty-one percent. He could work upstairs, but the WiFi was weak. He could go to the cafe, but it was closed. He could go to the bathroom, but he had promised himself he wouldn’t.

He went upstairs anyway. The dorm was back to full: a mix of snoring bodies and tangled chargers. The air was thick with humidity and stale beer. He crawled onto his bunk and opened his laptop. The WiFi flickered, then dropped. He tethered to his phone. The signal held, barely.

He opened the pitch deck and forced himself to edit. He cut a slide. He tightened a sentence. He replaced “synergy” with “traction” and felt like he had done something useful. He worked for an hour, stopping every few minutes to refresh his inbox in case a miracle had replied.

At ten-thirty, his phone buzzed. A response from Matt.

“Can’t help, sorry. Good luck.”

Marcus stared at the message until the letters blurred. He closed his eyes, opened them, and read it again. It didn’t change. He set the phone down and let the disappointment settle like dust.

He looked at his battery. Fifteen percent. He could make a call at fifteen. He could call Alan, or his mother, or Lina. He could call anyone, but the call would cost him the battery, and he didn’t know which call was the right one.

He got out of bed and walked to the window. The rain was still falling, the street below a blur of neon and water. The tangle of wires overhead looked like a dark map. He imagined the current running through them, invisible and steady. He imagined himself as another wire, strained and humming.

His phone buzzed again. A text from an unknown number.

“Marcus, this is Priya from Mira Ventures. Saw your email. Can you send a one-pager tonight?”

His heart jumped. Mira Ventures was small, but real. Priya had been a faint connection on LinkedIn, a person he had met once at a demo day and assumed had forgotten him. Tonight meant now. Tonight meant he needed to send something before she went to sleep.

He checked his battery. Fourteen percent. His laptop was at forty-six. The WiFi in the dorm was a single bar and fading. The router in the common room would be overloaded. The cafe was closed. The bathroom had three bars.

He felt the decision forming before he could stop it. He grabbed his laptop and charger, not because he wanted to but because he was too tired to improvise. He stepped into the hallway and felt the damp air wrap around him like a wet towel.

He went down the stairs. The common room was mostly empty now, the party crowd gone. Bee was cleaning the counter, the radio playing low. She looked up as he approached and her face changed.

“Don’t,” she said.

“I just need to send one file,” he said, and hated the way it sounded like every other excuse he had made. “I won’t plug in. I swear.”

Bee’s jaw tightened. “Every time you say that,” she said, “you go in with the charger.”

He looked at the charger cable in his hand and realized he hadn’t even tried to hide it. He put it in his backpack, a gesture that felt performative and useless. “I won’t plug in,” he repeated.

She stared at him for a long moment, then looked away. “I can’t stop you,” she said. “But I can’t watch.”

He wanted to apologize. He wanted to say he wasn’t trying to make her job harder. He wanted to say he was scared. He didn’t say any of it.

He opened the bathroom door.

The light flickered as if it recognized him. The puddle was deeper than before, the water covering the entire floor, reaching the threshold. The air smelled of ozone and wet concrete. He stepped inside and felt the water soak his socks immediately, a cold, sinking feeling.

He set his laptop on the sink and opened it. Three bars. Relief was a small, shameful surge.

He did not plug in the charger. He told himself he was keeping his promise. He told himself this was safe because he wasn’t connected to the wall. He told himself the phone battery would last long enough to send a one-pager.

He opened a document and started to write. The words came fast, a reflex: NomadSync is a platform for remote workers to discover and verify reliable infrastructure across emerging markets. We aggregate connectivity data, safety ratings, and community feedback to reduce risk and unlock distributed work at scale.

He wrote through the damp air, through the hum. He wrote the sentence he had written a hundred times, and it still felt like a lifeline. He attached the file to an email and hit send.

The email stalled at 87%.

He stared. The send bar froze. The WiFi bar dropped to two. The cursor turned into a spinning wheel.

He watched the progress bar like he watched his battery, like he watched his bank account, like he watched his life. It did not move.

He felt the familiar panic rise. He glanced at his phone. Thirteen percent. The laptop battery was at forty-two. The upload was stuck.

He looked at the charger cable in his backpack. He could plug in and stabilize the WiFi, perhaps. He could charge the phone while the file sent. He could buy himself ten more minutes.

He hesitated. The water was colder now, creeping into his socks, soaking through. He imagined Bee’s face. He imagined the sign on the door. He imagined the warning in his mother’s voice. He imagined Alan’s deadline. He imagined Priya closing her laptop and going to sleep.

He pulled the charger cable out.

The adapter clicked into the outlet with a soft crackle. A blue flash flared behind the cracked plate. The light flickered hard, then steadied. The charger light glowed green. The hum returned, thin and eager.

The send bar jumped from 87% to 100%.

He exhaled. He felt the small, guilty triumph of a system that worked just enough when he forced it to.

His phone buzzed with a low, brief vibration. He looked down. The battery icon was at twelve percent, rising. He watched it climb, one percentage at a time, while the water around his ankles felt suddenly colder.

He told himself: just to fifteen. Just to be safe. Just to make sure if Priya responds, you can answer.

He kept his eyes on the phone.

Behind him, the outlet crackled again, louder. The light flickered in a nervous stutter. He felt a faint tingling travel up his calves, a soft fizz that made his muscles twitch. He froze, then forced himself to relax. He told himself it was nothing. He told himself it was static. He told himself it was the nerves in his legs responding to adrenaline.

The battery hit thirteen.

He reached for the cord.

A low pop sounded from inside the wall. The light flickered in a sharper strobe. He smelled burning plastic, stronger now, and something else, a thin, metallic scent like a coin held under a flame. His heart kicked. His fingers tightened on the laptop edge.

He pulled the adapter out.

The light steadied. The hum faded. The tingling in his calves retreated like a tide.

He stood there, breathing hard, the phone at thirteen percent, the email sent. The room felt too small, the air too thick. He wiped his hand on his shirt and realized his palm smelled faintly of ozone.

He stepped out of the bathroom and closed the door, trying not to look at the sign.

Bee was by the desk, her back turned. He slipped past and climbed the stairs. His socks squelched with each step. He left wet footprints in the stairwell and felt, absurdly, like he was leaving a trail of evidence.

In the dorm, he collapsed onto his bunk. He checked his phone. A reply from Priya.

“Thanks. I’ll review in the morning.”

He stared at the message until it blurred. Morning. Another deadline, another wait. He set the phone down and looked at the ceiling stain, which had begun to spread into a shape that reminded him of a map.

He closed his eyes. The fan clicked. The rain softened. The hum of the building was a low, constant note. He thought about the outlet, about the crackle, about the smell. He thought about the way he had walked back into the bathroom even after Bee’s warning. He thought about the way he had promised himself he wouldn’t.

He told himself it was fine. He told himself he had only needed a few minutes. He told himself he had gotten what he needed.

Downstairs, the ground-floor bathroom light flickered once, twice, then held, as if the building had decided to stop warning him and start waiting.

In the dark, Marcus listened to the hum and felt the dampness in his socks like a reminder that the floor would still be wet tomorrow.
