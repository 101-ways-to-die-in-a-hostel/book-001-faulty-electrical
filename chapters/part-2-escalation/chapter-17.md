# Chapter 17: Leak Test

At 5:58 a.m., Marcus woke to the idea that the battery was dying faster than his pride.

The bunk above him squeaked as someone rolled over. The dorm smelled like sweat, detergent that never quite rinsed out, and the damp socks everyone pretended weren't theirs. His phone glowed a stubborn nine percent. It had lost three in the night, exactly as predicted. There was comfort in that, the way a forecast feels like a tiny victory when everything else is chaos.

He didn't check the time twice. He didn't check the WiFi bars. He swung his legs down, slid his feet into his Allbirds, and headed for the ground-floor bathroom with the same efficient urgency he used to bring to pitch meetings. If you get there before anyone else, you control the room. If you control the room, you control the narrative.

The hallway air was cooler this early, the building not yet warmed by the day. Emergency lights hummed with their sickly green glow, as if the main power still hadn't forgiven the night. He passed the reception desk. Bee had her head down on her folded arms, still, breathing slowly, a pen in her hand like a weapon she couldn't keep awake for. Her hair stuck to her forehead. Her phone screen showed a paused accounting lecture, the professor frozen mid-gesture. Marcus walked by on the balls of his feet, as if stealth could keep electricity from noticing him.

The bathroom door was closed. The sign on it had curled more overnight, the corner lifting like a wave. NO CHARGING. The letters had bled in the humidity, ghosting outward, as if the ink itself wanted to get away.

He pushed the door. It resisted and then gave. Inside, the smell hit him first. Bleach, mold, ozone, and something stale, like wet cardboard. The floor was wetter than last night. The puddle had spread, pooling thickly in the northeast corner where the outlet sat, as if the wall were sweating.

He shut the door behind him and listened. The rain was still there, a softer hiss now, but relentless. The pipe in the wall ticked with the sound of water cooling. The fluorescent light blinked once, steadied, blinked again. He told himself it was morning power, load balancing, some kind of grid behavior you could model.

He set his laptop on the sink. The ceramic was slick, slicker than it should have been, and he wiped it with the hem of his shirt before placing the computer again. The lid was smudged with fingerprints from last night. The Apple logo caught the light in the mirror and threw it back at him like an eye.

He glanced down at his shoes. The puddle was cold now. The water had seeped up into the fabric, darkening the merino. He'd told himself last night the rubber soles were enough. He told himself again, because the alternative was walking away.

He pulled the adapter from his bag. The plastic was warped along one edge, a faint scar that he couldn't unsee now. He held it to his nose. It smelled faintly of melted cheap toy, a plastic sweetness with a burnt edge. He told himself it was just old. He told himself he could replace it later. He told himself a lot of things, which was how he knew he was afraid.

The outlet stared at him from the wall. The blackened scorch marks were clearer in the morning light, like fingerprints left by fire. The handwritten sign drooped above it, a paper flag of surrender. He imagined Bee taping it there, the careful loops of her letters, as if language could do what repairs couldn't.

He crouched and rubbed the sole of his shoe against the tile, testing the grip. The floor was slick. The drain gurgled and did nothing. The coil of hair he had seen last night was still there, now joined by a strip of what looked like paper. He nudged it with his toe. The water trembled and then stilled.

"Just ten minutes," he whispered to the sink. "Just ten. Then I'm gone."

He reached for the outlet.

The first touch was nothing. The second touch was a prick, so fast he almost missed it. The third touch was a flicker of warmth against his knuckles. His skin lifted in gooseflesh. He drew his hand back and shook it once, like he could shake off a thought.

He could hear his father's voice, old and unkind in his head: Respect electricity. It doesn't care about your plan.

Marcus clenched his jaw. Plans were all he had. He pushed the adapter into the outlet and watched the tiny blue spark jump behind the plate like a warning blink. It was the briefest flash, gone before he could be sure it happened, but his body reacted anyway. His shoulders tightened. His heart bumped.

The charger brick glowed green.

He exhaled. Victory, on a tiny scale.

He hooked his phone to the laptop and watched the number tick up to ten percent. The WiFi bars in the corner of the screen climbed to three and then four. The signal in the bathroom had always been weirdly strong, a gap in the hostel's lousy coverage like a small miracle in a dark room.

He opened his email. The send status on last night's logs still showed Delivered. Relief loosened his chest by a millimeter.

There was a new email from Priya. Subject: "Next steps." His thumb hovered. He opened it.

"Thanks for the call. If you can share actual cohort retention for the last four weeks and confirm active user counts, we can schedule a follow-up. Also, please clarify runway and current liabilities."

He stared at the words, at the way "liabilities" sat in the line like a trap. He could spin it. He could say the liabilities were minimal, that the runway was stable, that this was all under control. He could do a lot of things. He could do all of them later. Right now, he needed battery, and the numbers on his phone were still in single digits.

A slow drip started from the shower head, one drop at a time, each drop falling into the puddle with a soft plip. The sound was maddening in the small room, a metronome counting down to something. He stared at the drip and thought about retention cohorts as drops of water, about metrics filling a bucket, about whether anyone ever checks the integrity of the bucket.

He leaned back against the wall and felt the paint tacky against his spine. The wall vibrated faintly. He couldn't tell if that was the building or his pulse.

The charger cable brushed his wrist. There was a faint tingling along his skin, a fizz like soda on the tongue, almost pleasant if he pretended it wasn't a warning. He moved his arm away.

The door handle rattled. "Hello?" a male voice called. "Anyone in?"

"Occupied," Marcus said.

There was a pause. "Dude, come on, it's been like fifteen minutes."

Marcus glanced down at the phone. Twelve percent. "Two minutes," he said. He hated how defensive it sounded.

The voice muttered something that sounded like "entropy" and the footsteps faded.

Marcus opened a spreadsheet. He started a new tab: Retention Cohort, Week 29-32. He began to fill in numbers, letting his brain do what it always did in a crisis: optimize, fake it, make it look like reality. His fingers moved quickly, the numbers forming a curve that rose just enough to look promising without looking suspicious. He told himself he'd fix it later. He told himself everyone did this. He told himself it was temporary.

The puddle warmed around his shoes. He could feel it through the soles now, a faint heat that shouldn't have been there. He shifted his weight and felt a small buzz rise from the floor into his calf. It was slight, almost like the vibration of a phone in a pocket, and it stopped when he lifted his heel.

Static, he told himself again. Humidity.

He kept working.

The phone ticked to fifteen percent. He unplugged it and felt the cable tug a little, an annoyed resistance. The adapter was warm. He almost burned his thumb on it and pulled back with a hiss.

He should have left it there. He should have unplugged everything and walked away. Instead, he watched the phone number and did the math: fifteen percent meant fifty-seven minutes of hotspot if he turned off the screen and didn't open video. If he could get to twenty-five, he could answer Lina. He could send Priya the fake cohorts without scrambling for a signal. He could be efficient.

He plugged it back in.

The charger brick hummed. The light flickered. The hum in the wall deepened, as if the building had noticed him again.

"Okay," he whispered. "Just ten more."

The door rattled again. "Bro."

"Sorry," he called. "Two minutes."

He watched the number climb: sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. His chest loosened with each digit, like the numbers themselves were giving him oxygen.

A faint crackle came from the outlet. He froze. The light flickered and then steadied. The crackle stopped. He told himself that if anything was going to happen, it would have happened already.

At twenty percent, he yanked the cable free. The outlet snapped with a tiny blue flash again, more visible this time. He saw it clearly and felt a hot sting behind his eyes, as if the light had burned his retinas.

He shoved everything into his bag and opened the door.

A thin British kid stood in the hall, blond hair plastered to his forehead, towel around his neck. He raised his eyebrows at Marcus and then at the bathroom behind him. "Is the WiFi good in there?" he asked.

"Unreal," Marcus said, and immediately hated himself.

The kid laughed and went in. Marcus walked away before he could hear the outlet hum in the other man's hands.

Bee was awake now, rubbing her eyes at the desk, her cheeks creased from sleep. She looked up as Marcus passed. Her gaze went to the bag slung over his shoulder, the cable coiled in the side pocket.

"No charging, okay?" she said. Her English was flat, tired.

"I didn't," he lied.

She held his gaze for a moment. There was no judgment in her face, just resignation. "It is not safe. Rain makes it worse." She glanced toward the street, where the light was turning grey. "Today too much rain."

"Yeah," he said. "I'll be careful." He smiled like a man who knows how to sell anything.

She turned back to her computer. The lecture resumed, the professor's mouth moving in silent explanation. Marcus walked out into the corridor and felt the air on his face, damp and heavy, like a towel laid over his head.

---

By noon, the city had turned into a slow boil.

Marcus sat in the common room under a ceiling fan that barely moved the air. The fan made a clicking noise with each rotation, like something in it was being forced. The room was a patchwork of smells: noodles, sweat, beer from last night, and the lemon disinfectant the cleaner had splashed on the tile floors. A British girl slept on the couch with her mouth open and a bucket hat tipped over her eyes. Two Australians argued over the word "ironic" at a plastic table. A French guy edited a vlog, the tinny sound of his own voice bleeding through his earbuds.

Marcus had a spreadsheet open, the fake cohort numbers now in neat rows, but he kept glancing at the phone in his lap. The battery sat at twenty-three percent, holding. He had messaged Lina a neutral reply, something about being busy, catching up later. She responded with a single thumbs-up emoji, which felt worse than any lecture.

His stomach growled. He hadn't eaten since a protein bar at dawn. He weighed the cost of noodles against the cost of a coffee and decided on both. He went to the kitchen, dropped coins into the donation jar, and stirred boiling water into a cup of instant noodles. The steam rose and fogged his glasses. He wiped them on his shirt, the blue-light coating smearing like oil.

He carried the cup back to his corner and opened Twitter. His feed was a mess of startup pep and travel envy. Somewhere in the middle was @HostelReaper, the account that had become a perverse kind of weather report. The new post was a close-up of a wet towel draped over a chair, the fabric dripping onto a tile floor. The caption read: "Just because it dries doesn't mean it's safe."

He snorted and scrolled past. Paranoia could be a marketing strategy now. He clicked on a thread about "founder resilience" and told himself he was doing the right thing by staying in the game. He told himself he couldn't afford to be delicate, not now.

Across the room, the Australians were still arguing. One of them, a tall guy with a sunburned neck, gestured toward the bathroom hallway and said, "Mate, did you feel that shock?" His friend shrugged. "It's the power here, it's dodgy. Gave me a buzz when I touched the tap."

Marcus lifted his eyes, then went back to his screen. People exaggerated all the time. People complained. People didn't optimize their behavior. He told himself the tap had a loose ground, a simple thing, easily avoided. He told himself he wasn't like those guys.

His phone buzzed with an email alert. Priya again, shorter this time: "Need the numbers by 5pm Bangkok time." The message felt like a hand on his throat.

He glanced at the clock on the wall. 12:37. He had time. He had battery. He had a plan.

He opened the spreadsheet and began to craft the narrative. Numbers were easy. Numbers obeyed. He knew how to tell a story with data because data was story when you knew where to pinch it. He built a curve that rose with just enough friction to seem real. He imagined Priya reading it, nodding, penciling in a follow-up, maybe even a term sheet. He imagined relief so strong it felt like air after a storm.

Outside, the rain started again, an afternoon downpour with no warning and no plan. It hit the tin awning in sheets. The sound filled the common room, a roaring white noise that made everyone look up for a moment, then back down into their screens.

The lights flickered. Once, twice, steady. The fan wobbled, clicked, and kept turning. Marcus felt a small thump in his chest that he told himself was caffeine.

He saved the spreadsheet and drafted an email to Priya: "Attached is the cohort retention and active users for weeks 29-32. Note the uptick in week 31 driven by the Thai hostel partnership test." He added a smiley face, then deleted it. He attached the file and hovered over send.

His laptop battery icon flashed red. He had meant to charge it in the morning and didn't. The cord in his bag felt heavy and inevitable.

He stared at the hallway leading to the bathroom. He stared at the numbers on his phone. He stared at the thin line between convenience and risk and felt it tighten like a wire.

He considered the back courtyard. The WiFi there was weak. The sockets in the common room were all taken by people who had been here longer and owned more chargers than dignity. He considered asking them to unplug, but the thought of that conversation made his skin itch. He considered going to a cafe, but the rain was a sheet and his laptop would get drenched and he didn't have the margin for wet hardware. He considered waiting, but Priya's email had a deadline and deadlines were sacred.

He stood.

He walked toward the bathroom.

---

The hallway was cooler now, the air damp with rain and disinfectant. The bathroom door was ajar. A small puddle had escaped into the hall, a dark tongue licking at the tile. Marcus stepped around it and pushed the door.

Inside, the light was on, a thin, tired fluorescent hum. The puddle had grown; it occupied most of the floor now, a shallow lake reflecting the dull light. The sign above the outlet had fallen halfway off the wall, held by a single strip of tape. The outlet plate was darker than before, a shadowed scar.

He set his laptop on the sink and pulled out the charger. His fingers hesitated just long enough to register that they were hesitating. He took a breath and pushed the adapter in.

A crackle. A blue-white flash. The charger light blinked, went out, blinked again, and steadied.

He muttered, "Jesus," under his breath, and pretended the sound had been nothing.

The laptop chimed. The battery began to climb. He plugged his phone in too, tethering to the strong signal, and watched the WiFi bars leap up. He opened his email, attached the spreadsheet, and hit Send before he could think too long about anything else.

A drip fell from the shower head, the metronome back again. The drain gurgled and held. The water was warmer now, or maybe he was. He could feel it through his shoes, a faint warmth, like the floor had absorbed the day's heat and was giving it back.

He stood with his back against the wall and scrolled through his numbers, checking for errors. He imagined Priya opening the file, the rows of metrics sliding under her eyes. He imagined the relief. He imagined the call that would come after.

His phone buzzed. Lina, again: "Are you okay? Mom is worried."

He typed back, "Busy. All good. Will call later." He hesitated and added, "Don't worry."

He knew even as he sent it that it wouldn't help.

The light flickered. The charger hummed. He watched the phone climb: twenty-eight, twenty-nine. The screen made the puddle glow faintly, a thin reflected rectangle in the water.

The door rattled. A woman's voice, German accent. "Hello?"

"Occupied," Marcus said.

"Again?" she muttered, but he couldn't tell if she was addressing him or the hostel.

He waited for the number to hit thirty-five. It took longer than it should have. The charge was slower, as if the wall itself were tired. He pressed his hand against the outlet plate without thinking, a reflexive check. The heat startled him. It was warm, warmer than before, the warmth deep enough that it felt alive. He pulled his hand back and stared at his fingers, half-expecting to see them singed.

He told himself it was because the room was small and the wiring was old. He told himself it was because electricity makes heat and heat makes heat and everything is just physics. He told himself that physics could be negotiated if you were smart enough.

The puddle touched the toe of his shoe. He stepped back without looking. His heel bumped the wall. He shifted his weight and felt his sock, soaked and cold now, cling to his foot like a second skin. He wondered, briefly, how much water was too much.

The charger cable brushed his forearm again. The faint fizz returned, more insistent this time, a low buzz that ran up to his elbow. He shook his arm and the sensation lingered, then faded.

Static, he told himself, but he didn't believe it anymore.

He looked at the outlet and saw, for the first time, a thin line of moisture seeping from the crack in the wall plate. It was barely a bead, a small shine. It ran down, slow, like a tear.

He imagined the wire inside, bare and damp, the copper exposed and alive. He imagined the puddle rising to meet it. He imagined his own body as a bridge.

The light flickered twice. The charger hummed. The phone hit thirty-three percent.

He thought about leaving now, about taking what he had and walking away. He thought about the email he'd just sent. He thought about Priya's deadline. He thought about his mother, his sister, the fifteen seconds of his father's voice in his head. He thought about the person he had to be to survive this, and the person he was.

He stayed.

He stared at the numbers and waited for thirty-five.

When it came, he pulled the cable free. The outlet snapped with the now-familiar blue flash, a sting of light on the wall. The light flickered once and steadied. He grabbed his laptop and shoved it into his bag, barely caring that it was still warm.

He opened the door and almost collided with Bee.

She was holding a mop bucket, her face tired, her hair tied back with a rubber band. She looked past him into the bathroom, eyes narrowing. Her gaze went to the outlet, to the puddle, to the cable hanging out of his bag.

"You charge again," she said. It wasn't a question.

He shrugged. "Just needed to send something." He tried to make his voice light, like this was nothing.

She sighed. "It is dangerous. I told you. It is more dangerous now. You feel?" She tapped her fingers on the wall by the doorframe, then rubbed them together as if she'd felt something there too. "Sometimes shock. I feel in hand."

"I'll be careful," he said.

"Careful not enough." Her voice was quiet. She wasn't angry. She was tired. "We ask boss. He say later. Always later. You not listen. He not listen. Later come."

He didn't know what to say. He wanted to tell her he heard her, he wanted to tell her he didn't have a choice, he wanted to tell her that the people he needed to impress didn't care about his choice. He said none of those things.

"Thanks," he said, because it was the only word that came.

Bee stepped aside and wheeled the bucket in. He walked past her, the damp air clinging to him like a film, and made his way back to the common room.

---

By evening, the rain had turned the street into a river.

Marcus sat on the edge of his bunk, watching water run down the glass of the stairwell window in thick ropes. The city outside was a blur of neon and headlights smeared by rain. The sound was constant, like a crowd breathing.

His laptop sat open on the bed, the screen glowing with Priya's reply: "Received. Reviewing. Let's reconnect tomorrow."

He exhaled. He had done it. The numbers were out. The lie was in the world now, growing roots.

His phone was at forty percent. It was not enough. It was never enough. He needed to stay ready. He needed to be able to take the call, to tether if needed, to keep the narrative alive. The call could come at any hour. Investors loved to make founders wait.

The bunk above him was empty. The mattress squeaked when someone walked in the hall. Someone laughed in the distance, the sound bouncing off the tiled walls. The air in the dorm was thick, a damp heat that made his skin shine.

He checked his email again. Nothing. He checked LinkedIn. A new post from a former classmate: "Exited today. Grateful for the journey." He stared at the word "Exited" and felt something in his chest twist.

His phone buzzed, a notification from the Whoop app: "High strain day. Consider recovery."

He turned the phone face down.

He thought about going to the rooftop. The rain would soak him. He thought about going to the common room. It would be loud. He thought about sleeping. He would wake at 2 a.m. with the battery lower, with more anxiety. He thought about the bathroom.

The bathroom was quiet. The bathroom had signal. The bathroom had an outlet.

He stood up.

The corridor was darker now, the emergency lights casting long green shadows. The stairs creaked under his weight. Somewhere below, the building groaned. He felt the dampness in the air, a humid blanket that made his skin sticky.

At the reception desk, Bee wasn't there. The chair was empty. The counter had a sticky note with a phone number and the word "Back" in English. The hallway to the bathroom was empty.

He stopped at the door. The sign hung limply, one corner detached. The word NO looked like a plea now rather than a command.

He hesitated, a second longer than he wanted. He thought about Bee's face. He thought about the blue flash. He thought about the warmth in the outlet. He thought about the way the puddle had felt, like the floor had a pulse.

He pushed the door open.

The bathroom smelled worse at night, more mildew, more bleach, a sharp edge of something burned. The puddle was deeper, almost to the tile ridges. The water reflected the fluorescent light in a trembling sheet. The outlet plate gleamed with dampness. The crack in it was darker, the wiring inside like a vein.

He set his laptop on the sink. The ceramic rocked slightly under the weight, and he steadied it with his hand. His fingers were damp. He wiped them on his shorts and reached for the adapter.

He paused.

In his head, numbers ran like a ticker. Battery percent. Hours of tether. Chances of Priya calling. Odds of another spark. He tried to weigh them the way he weighed everything, like a risk model, like a spreadsheet. But the numbers didn't make sense. The variables were too many, the margins too thin.

He felt the phone in his pocket vibrate with a phantom buzz. He pulled it out. Forty-one percent. He could wait. He could sleep. He could do it in the morning.

He plugged the adapter in anyway.

The outlet snapped and flashed. The light flickered. The charger hummed. The green light came on like a tiny go-ahead.

He stared at it, the small green light reflected in the puddle. The water glowed faintly, a green eye staring up.

"Just a few minutes," he said to the room. "Just to keep it topped off." He said it as if the room could be negotiated with.

He connected the phone, then the laptop. He watched the battery climb, the numbers slow and stubborn. The puddle touched the soles of his shoes. The water was warm now, almost pleasant, and that terrified him more than the cold.

Outside, thunder rolled, a distant metal growl. The light flickered in time, a strobe that made his shadow jerk against the wall. He felt the floor vibrate under his feet. He felt the faint buzz in the cable creep into his wrist.

He thought about Bee's warning. He thought about his father's voice. He thought about the last time he'd touched an outlet as a kid, the shock that had made him yelp and laugh. He thought about how small he had been, how invincible.

He told himself he was still invincible.

The phone hit forty-five. He reached to unplug it.

His hand hovered over the plug. The puddle was a mirror. The outlet was a mouth. The room was holding its breath.

He grasped the cable.

The light flickered again.

He did not let go.

---

In the hallway, someone laughed. In the street outside, the rain kept falling. In the wall, the current waited, patient and indifferent, like a decision already made.
