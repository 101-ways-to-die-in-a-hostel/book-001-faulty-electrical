# Chapter 13: Load Shedding

The notification arrived like a slap on a bruise.

Mira Ventures: Can you hop on a call today? We can do 6 PM Bangkok if that works.

Marcus stared at the screen in the dim dorm light, squinting past the spiderweb crack that crossed his phone like a hairline fracture. The battery icon glowed at eight percent, bright as a warning light on a dashboard. He felt the day tighten around him. Six PM was in ten hours. Ten hours was plenty, if you were the kind of person who could keep your phone alive for ten hours in a hostel that treated electricity like a rumor.

He sat up too fast and the room swam. The fan clicked overhead like a slow metronome. A guy on the bottom bunk was putting in contact lenses with the calm focus of someone doing brain surgery. Someone else coughed wetly in the corner. The air smelled of damp clothes and disinfectant, of last night and the morning after.

Six PM. An investor call. His chest did a quick, stupid flip as if success were already on the other side. He opened his calendar and counted the hours with his thumb. He needed to send a few numbers to Priya. He needed to pull the latest data, the little chart he had made out of nothing. He needed a stable connection. He needed a charged phone.

He looked at his socks. They were still stiff around the ankles from last night, the dampness cured into them like salt. He peeled them off and his feet were cold, the skin wrinkled and pale at the edges like they had been soaking longer than they had. He rubbed them dry with the corner of his towel and told himself he would not go into the bathroom today. He would go to the cafe. He would spend seventy baht and take the call like a person with a plan. He would not count his life in battery percentages.

He put on his shoes anyway, even though the inside still felt damp. He plugged his phone into the dorm outlet to give it a few extra minutes. The adapter made its soft, insect-like buzz. The charger light flickered once and held. He watched it the way you watch a sleeping animal, ready to jump at any sudden movement.

By the time his phone hit twelve percent, his stomach was tight with coffee hunger. He unplugged it and put it in his pocket before he could talk himself into twelve turning into fifteen. He grabbed his laptop and headed downstairs.

The common room was quieter than he expected, just Bee behind the desk and a British girl with a mop of blond hair scrolling through photos of beaches she wasn't at. The rain had let up to a fine mist, turning the front doorway into a grey frame of damp light. The sign on the bathroom door was still there, now reinforced with a strip of red tape. DANGER — DO NOT CHARGE ELECTRONICS IN THIS BATHROOM. Someone had added another line beneath it in sharper pen: NO CALLS EITHER.

Bee looked up. She didn't smile.

"You look busy," she said.

"Call today," Marcus said, lifting his phone like proof.

Bee's eyes flicked to the red tape. "Not in bathroom. You promise yesterday. You promise day before. You always promise." She said it like a weather report.

"I won't," he said. He meant it. He even believed it, for the length of a blink.

He stepped outside, the humidity wrapping around him like a wet towel. Khao San Road was still waking up, vendors pulling tarps off their carts, buckets of fruit stacked under umbrellas. The wires overhead drooped in black loops, heavy with rain. He walked the four blocks to Byte & Brew, stepping around puddles that reflected the neon signs like broken mirrors.

When he reached the cafe, the lights were out.

A handwritten sign on the door said POWER OUT. The barista sat behind the counter with a phone flashlight aimed at a register, counting change in the dark. He shrugged at Marcus without looking up.

Marcus stared at the sign like it had personally betrayed him. He checked his phone. Eleven percent. He felt the math rearrange itself in his head, the variables clicking into place. No cafe. No stable WiFi. One call at six. A dwindling battery. The bathroom waiting like a compromise he didn't want to make.

He walked back to the hostel, the rain starting again in a soft, impatient drizzle. The wires overhead hissed as the drops hit them. A motorbike cut through a puddle and Marcus flinched at a tiny blue spark near a sagging junction. He told himself it was just the reflection of a neon sign.

At the hostel entrance, a cluster of backpackers had formed a semicircle around an outlet by the honor-system fridge. Someone had taped a travel power strip to the wall with duct tape, the cords drooping like wet spaghetti. A girl in elephant pants poked at one of the plugs with the tip of a pen, then jerked her hand back and laughed.

"It bit me," she said, smiling at her friend. "Like a static thing."

"Static is a lot of things," Marcus said before he could stop himself. The girl gave him a look that made him realize he was not in a meeting and didn't need to sound authoritative. He tried a different smile, a softer one, and she shrugged like he was another ghost in the hostel.

Bee was behind the desk, talking to a man in a damp button-down shirt who was waving a receipt. The man gestured toward the ceiling and then the bathroom, his face pinched with annoyance. Bee listened, nodded once, and said something in Thai Marcus couldn't catch. The man left, muttering. Bee looked over and met Marcus's eyes for a second, the look that said: Another complaint. Another bill. Another day. Marcus felt the impulse to apologize for all of it and knew that it wouldn't help.

He went up to the rooftop instead. The stairs smelled like wet wood and old sweat. At the top, the roof was slick and empty except for Ruth, perched on a plastic chair with her feet on another chair, trying to keep them out of the puddles. She had a cigarette in her hand, unlit.

"You look like you lost a bet," she said.

"Cafe's out," he said.

"Power's out everywhere," she said. "The city does this thing where it pretends it's modern until the rain shows up." She looked at his phone. "You get your miracle call?"

"Six PM," he said. "Investor. I need to be online."

Ruth whistled softly. "Big night."

"It's just a call," he said, though he could feel his pulse quicken. "If it goes well, it could open some doors."

"If it goes badly, you still need to pay rent," she said. "Doors are funny like that."

He almost laughed. The rooftop offered two bars of WiFi for thirty seconds and then dropped. He tried again, held the phone above his head, moved toward the corner near the string lights. The bars flickered and died. He shook his head.

"Bathroom's still the best signal, right?" Ruth asked, the question casual but her eyes not.

He didn't answer. The rain spattered harder. A drop hit the string lights and a few bulbs flickered, a nervous shimmer. Ruth watched the wires overhead, the black tangle sagging with water.

"You know there's a reason those signs exist," she said. "They don't put them up for decoration."

"I know," he said. He didn't add: I just don't know what else to do.

On the way back down, he passed the second-floor bathroom. The door was open, steam drifting into the hallway. A guy in a towel leaned against the sink, holding his phone and grinning. "WiFi's better in here too," he said to no one. He plugged his charger into the wall and the light above the sink blinked once. The guy didn't notice.

Marcus kept walking. He told himself it wasn't his responsibility. He told himself people had to make their own choices. The thought tasted like chalk.

Back in the dorm, he opened the @HostelReaper account, a ritual he had developed like a nervous tick. The latest post was a photo of a two-prong adapter lying in a puddle, captioned: "When you treat water like a coworking space, it will eventually give you feedback." He stared at it longer than he meant to, the words sliding under his skin like a needle. He closed the app and pretended it hadn't gotten to him.

Inside, the hostel was darker than usual. The TV was off. The router's green light blinked in a slow, tired rhythm. He connected his laptop anyway and watched the WiFi bar climb to one, then drop to none.

He sat on a mismatched couch and opened his email draft to Priya, the one that had sat in his outbox overnight like a confession. He started to update the numbers from memory. He guessed. He fudged. He hated himself for it and did it anyway.

He sent the email, watching the progress bar stall at forty percent. It hung there, unmoving, like a runner frozen mid-stride. He waited. It did not move.

The door to the bathroom was five feet away. He could hear the faint buzz of the fluorescent light inside. He could smell bleach and damp concrete. His skin prickled with the memory of the tingling in his calves the night before.

He told himself: I can send this later. I can go upstairs and tether. I can go to the roof and pray for bars. He told himself a lot of things and then did what he always did when the math stopped adding up.

He stood. He picked up his laptop. He walked to the bathroom door.

The red tape on the sign was new, glossy and bright against the peeling wall. He peeled it back just enough to open the door. The tape clung to his fingers. The room was a humid box of light and water, the puddle bigger than it had ever been, a shallow sheet that reached the threshold. The drain in the center gurgled once, a wet, resentful sound. The outlet plate was cracked wide enough that he could see the corroded wire behind it, green and frayed like something organic.

He stepped inside and felt the water soak through his shoes immediately. The sensation made him wince. He set his laptop on the sink. Two bars of WiFi. His email progress bar jumped from forty to sixty.

He did not plug in the charger. He stood still, shoes submerged, and watched the email crawl forward. He told himself he was obeying the rules. He told himself the water didn't matter if he wasn't connected to the wall. He told himself his socks were already wet, as if that made it less dangerous.

The bar hit eighty percent and froze again.

His phone buzzed in his pocket, the low battery warning. He pulled it out. Nine percent. He felt a flash of irritation so hot it almost felt like relief. He looked at the charger cable in his backpack. He could plug in for just a minute, just enough to stabilize the send and bump the battery. He could stop the rationalization before it started and walk away. He stared at the outlet plate like it was a mouth.

The email progress bar ticked to eighty-one, eighty-two. It moved without help. He left the charger in his bag.

When it hit one hundred, he let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. He closed the laptop and turned to leave.

As he stepped toward the door, the light flickered. Once, twice, a quick nervous stutter. He froze in the water. The buzz in the room deepened into a lower, hungrier hum. He felt the tingle in his soles, faint but there, like the first spark of a match. He lifted his foot and set it down again, and the tingle sharpened for a second before fading.

He pulled the door open and stepped out into the hallway with a jolt of relief that felt almost like giddiness. Bee was behind the desk, not looking at him. He didn't look at her.

Upstairs, the dorm was chaos. The power had returned to some rooms but not others. A French guy was standing on a chair with a plug in one hand and a phone in the other, swearing in two languages. Marcus plugged his phone into the dorm outlet and watched the charger light flicker, then die. He unplugged and tried again. Nothing. The outlet had joined the rest of the building in its quiet revolt.

He checked his email. The message to Priya had sent. A small wave of relief passed through him and left him hollow. He set an alarm for five forty-five, because he had learned that the hallway clock was never right, and laid down with his laptop on his chest like a shield.

He dozed in thin, broken slivers. Every time he drifted, his phone buzzed with another warning: low battery, no signal, low storage. The hostel hummed beneath him, the wires in the walls carrying the city like veins. At some point he dreamed that his phone battery was a heart monitor, and every percentage point was a beat.

At five forty-five, the alarm went off and then died. The battery had reached one percent and surrendered. He stared at the blank screen and felt his throat tighten.

He could take the call on his laptop. The laptop had seventy percent. The WiFi in the dorm was dead. The router downstairs blinked its tired green eye. The bathroom had three bars.

He sat up, the decision already forming. He hated how quickly it formed, how little resistance his brain put up now that it had found a path. He grabbed his laptop, shoved the phone into his pocket, and headed down the stairs.

Bee was at the desk. She looked up and her expression closed like a door.

"Not in bathroom," she said.

"I have a call," he said. The words came out too sharp. "Six PM. It's important. It's an investor. This is the only place with WiFi." He knew he sounded like every guest who had ever tried to negotiate with the laws of physics.

Bee stood, her chair scraping the tile. "You can take call in hallway. You can sit here. You can go outside. You do not go in there." She pointed to the bathroom door, the red tape still hanging like a scab.

"The WiFi doesn't reach," he said. "It drops." He lifted his laptop like a peace offering. "I won't plug in. I'll just stand in the doorway. I promise."

She looked at him, and he saw not anger but fear, the tired fear of someone who had seen the same mistake repeat. "You don't listen," she said, softer now. "You never listen. You think because you have laptop you are safe. Electricity does not care if you are smart."

It was the kind of sentence that would have sounded poetic in a different context. Here it just felt like a slap.

"Five minutes," he said.

"No," she said. Her voice didn't rise. It didn't need to.

He turned away from her and walked to the bathroom anyway.

She called his name. He didn't turn back.

Inside, the bathroom felt smaller than it had that morning. The puddle was higher, a thin inch of water that covered the entire floor. The air smelled of ozone and something faintly burnt. The fluorescent light buzzed with a high, insect sound that made his teeth itch. The outlet plate was darker at the edges now, the scorch marks widening like a stain.

He set his laptop on the sink and opened it. Three bars. Relief surged through him, immediate and shameful. He opened the meeting link Priya had sent. The clock in the corner read 5:58. He clicked join.

The video loaded. His own face appeared, pale and slightly distorted in the flicker of the bathroom light. He adjusted his glasses and tried to smooth his hair with a wet hand. He remembered that his hand was wet and wiped it on his shirt.

Priya appeared on the screen at 6:01, her background a neat office with a plant that looked too well watered. "Marcus," she said, smiling politely. "Thanks for making time."

"Of course," he said. He tried to sound casual, as if he wasn't standing in an inch of water in a hostel bathroom with a flickering light and a dying phone.

She asked him to walk through the deck. He did, speaking faster than he meant to. He hit all the points, the vision, the market, the traction he didn't have. He smiled when he needed to. He used the words he was good at: scale, leverage, network effects. His voice sounded steady in his own ears, but his skin prickled with the awareness of the water around his feet and the hum in the walls.

At minute six, the WiFi stuttered. The video froze with Priya mid-blink. Marcus stared at his own frozen face, a faint grimace. The screen froze for three seconds, then snapped back.

"Sorry," he said, even though it wasn't his fault.

"No worries," Priya said. "We've all been there." She did not sound convinced.

He kept talking. He tried to keep his body still to avoid sloshing the water. His calves ached with the tension of holding still. The tingle returned, a faint fizz at his soles that crept up to his ankles. He ignored it. He focused on the deck, on the words, on the image of his future self who did not need to take calls in bathrooms.

At minute ten, Priya asked about his runway. He lied. At minute twelve, she asked about regulatory risk. He dodged. At minute fifteen, she asked about his team's size. He said "lean" in the way people say "small" when they're trying to make it sound like a strategy.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. He ignored it. The battery warning kept buzzing, little insect taps against his thigh.

Priya leaned forward. "Let me be direct," she said. "I like the problem. I like your energy. But I need to see proof of demand. Do you have user data? Real numbers?"

Marcus swallowed. The words he had rehearsed did not fit. He could feel the truth rising like water. "We have early interest," he said. "We have a waitlist." He did not say how long the waitlist was or how much of it was his mother and his friends.

She nodded slowly. "Okay. Here's what I can do. If you can send me a one-page update with actual user metrics and a clearer financial model by tomorrow morning, I can bring this to my partner meeting. I can't promise anything, but I can put it in the room." She paused. "Can you do that?"

He said yes immediately. He said it with the same instinct that had made him promise Alan and his mother and Bee. He said yes because the alternative felt like death.

"Great," Priya said. "I'll look for it by nine AM our time." She smiled again, polite and distant. "Good luck, Marcus."

"Thank you," he said. The call ended.

He stared at his reflection on the dark screen and felt the adrenaline drain. The silence in the bathroom was thick. The hum from the light filled the space like a low insect swarm.

He checked his phone. Two percent. He pulled the charger cable out of his backpack. He told himself he needed to charge so he could send the one-pager. He told himself he would be quick. He told himself he had already done the dangerous part by standing in the water, so it didn't matter now. He told himself a lot of things.

He plugged in.

A blue flash flared behind the outlet plate, brighter than before. The light flickered in a sharp strobe. The hum in the room rose to a high, teeth-hurting whine. He felt a hard tingle shoot up his legs to his knees, a jolt that made his muscles seize for a fraction of a second. He sucked in a breath and held it.

The charger light turned green. The phone buzzed and ticked up to three percent. He stared at it like a heart monitor.

He told himself: just to ten. Just so it doesn't die mid-email. Just to be safe.

The light flickered again, slower this time. The outlet crackled, a dry, brittle pop. The smell of burning plastic sharpened. He could taste metal on his tongue.

He reached for the plug.

His fingers brushed the adapter and he felt a brief, sharp prickle, a pin of heat. He yanked his hand back as if he had touched a stove. The tingle in his legs spiked and then faded.

He stared at his hand, flexing his fingers. The skin was unmarked. His heart was hammering.

"Okay," he whispered to the empty room. "Okay."

The phone hit five percent. He pulled the adapter out. The hum dropped. The light steadied. He exhaled and felt his shoulders drop as if he had been holding them against his ears.

He left the bathroom without looking at the sign. Bee was not at the desk. The common room was empty, the TV still off. The rain had started again, harder now, a steady drum on the roof.

Upstairs, he sat on his bunk and opened his laptop. He tethered to his phone and watched the battery slip from five to four. He started a new document titled Metrics. The page was blank. He stared at it, the cursor blinking like a heartbeat.

He invented numbers the way he always had, starting with reasonable lies and then smoothing them into plausible truth. He told himself he would replace them later. He told himself he had to get through tonight.

At midnight, his phone died. He kept typing anyway, tethering to the dorm WiFi that barely existed. He watched the document autosave and prayed the connection held. The rain kept falling, the fan clicking, the hostel humming.

At one, he sent the one-pager to Priya from his laptop, fingers trembling with exhaustion. The email whooshed away. He leaned back and felt a wave of nausea that wasn't hunger.

He set his dead phone on the pillow beside him like a small animal. He closed his eyes and listened to the building. The hum was louder tonight, a low, constant note. The rain made the wires outside shiver. The ceiling stain above his bed had spread, the edges dark like bruises.

Below, someone laughed in the common room, a short bark that died quickly. A door slammed. The fan clicked. The hostel felt like a body that couldn't sleep, twitching in its dreams. Marcus tried to breathe in time with it, the way his meditation app once told him to sync with his surroundings. He could not find a rhythm. Every sound was a reminder of other people's electricity, other people's lives plugged into the same tired circuit.

He knew he had to charge the phone before morning. He knew the dorm outlet was unreliable. He knew the bathroom had the best chance.

He told himself he would go down early, before anyone was awake, before Bee could stop him. He told himself it would be quick, just enough to wake the phone, just enough to get the response if Priya wrote back.

He lay there and listened to the rain and the hum. The building felt like a tired machine that wanted to shut off but couldn't, not with all these bodies plugged into it. He felt his own exhaustion sink into the mattress. He imagined the bathroom door, the red tape, the puddle waiting like a patient animal.

In the dark, his stomach churned with a mix of hope and dread. He whispered to no one, "Just one more charge." The words sounded like a promise and a warning at the same time.
