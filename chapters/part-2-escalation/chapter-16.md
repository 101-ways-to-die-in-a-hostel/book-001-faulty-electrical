# Chapter 16: Current Draw

The adapter slid into the outlet with the soft, reluctant click of something pretending to cooperate.

Marcus felt the wall answer. Not a sound, exactly, but a pressure, a faint pulse that lifted the hair on his forearms. The bathroom light trembled. The puddle at his feet shivered as if something had breathed under it. He held still, the adapter halfway in, and waited for the building to decide if it wanted him.

It did. The charger brick blinked from red to green. The laptop chimed as if a small miracle had just been approved. For a moment, he grinned at the little light, the way you grin when the elevator finally opens after an awkward pause.

He left the adapter where it was.

There was a rule, and there was his need. The rule was written in pen on the door, in English and Thai, a desperate little bilingual truce. The need was in his chest, an email shaped like a door he couldn't let close. He told himself he could manage both. He told himself there were systems for risk. He told himself the hostel's sign was about policy, not physics.

He set the laptop on the sink, the ceramic slick with humidity, and kept his shoes on. The puddle had crept over the tops of his Allbirds, soaking the merino like a sponge, but the rubber sole felt like a boundary. He was still insulated, still separated. He was still in control.

The WiFi bars climbed to three. He exhaled.

The rain, outside the walls, was a constant applause. It hit the roof in sheets, ran down the old shophouse seams, and found every crack. The bathroom smelled like bleach and mildew and something sharp that made his tongue taste metal. The exhaust fan rattled once and then went silent. The fluorescent light buzzed in a tired, insect way. The outlet plate looked damp around the edges, a dark halo that spread and disappeared into the wall.

He checked the time. 11:09. He had twenty-one minutes to get his laptop stable, his screen share ready, his lie organized.

Marcus opened the call app and set everything up. Camera off. Mic on. Screen share queued. He opened the demo dashboard and the backend logs in separate tabs. He rehearsed the path between them with the kind of quick, efficient movements that had once impressed investors in glass rooms. He practiced the sentences he would say if the connection stuttered. He rehearsed the casual laugh he would use if the screen froze.

His phone ticked down: five percent, four. The tether burned through it like a candle.

He stared at the phone. He stared at the charger brick. He stared at the thin cable that ran from the wall to the laptop, that ran from the laptop to the phone. A chain of dependencies, a system built on a puddle.

He told himself: just enough to get through the call. Just enough to keep the tether alive. A short, controlled draw. He was, after all, a founder. He knew how to draw current without tripping the breaker.

He plugged the phone into the laptop. He didn't touch the wall again.

The battery number stopped falling. Then, blessedly, it climbed. Six percent. He felt a rush that was completely out of proportion to the number. He felt like he had won something.

A flicker ran through the light. The charger brick hummed. His hair lifted, then settled. He pretended not to notice.

The minutes before the call stretched. The bathroom was too small to pace, so he shifted his weight from foot to foot, the water sloshing around his shoes in a shallow, impatient circle. He could feel the soggy merino sock cling to his toes. He told himself the rubber sole was enough. He told himself the wire had been taped. He told himself a lot of things, the way you do in a room that has no windows.

He looked at the door again. The DANGER sign was still there, a crooked strip of paper that had started to curl at the corners. The marker bled in the humidity, the letters warping as if the warning were trying to soften itself. In the mirror, it read backward and more like a suggestion: REGNAD.

He checked his phone. Seven percent. Eight. The numbers rose with the slow relief of an elevator in an old building. He watched them, irrationally grateful, and then opened his inbox anyway. A spammy newsletter from a VC fund he had once pitched. A bounced invoice from a co-working space in SoMa. A subject line from his mother that said simply: “Checking in.” He didn't open it. He felt the weight of the word pressing on the screen, heavier than the water around his feet.

He toggled to LinkedIn because that was where he went when he wanted to feel like he still belonged somewhere. The feed was full of clean people in clean spaces, smiling under neon signs that read FOUNDERS. A guy from his Stanford cohort had posted a photo of himself in front of a Series B check. “Grateful for the journey,” the caption said. Marcus scrolled past fast, but the image left a residue, a faint itch behind his eyes.

He told himself he could still be that guy. He told himself this was just a rough patch, a minor outage. He could fix a rough patch. He could even pivot. He had done it before. He was not the kind of person who lost to plumbing.

The drain gurgled. The puddle trembled. He looked down and saw a coil of black hair plastered over the drain like a seal. He nudged it with his shoe, watching the water shift but not move. The hair clung, stubborn as a bad idea. He left it. The water would go where it wanted.

He wiped his palms on his shorts and felt the fabric come away damp. He tapped the outlet plate with the back of his knuckle, as if a gentle knock could make the building behave. A tiny pinch zipped up his finger. He pulled back and laughed once, reflexively, as if the wall had made a joke. The laugh sounded wrong in the small room.

He glanced at the time again. 11:27. Three minutes. He closed his eyes and inhaled. The air tasted of bleach and ozone and something that reminded him of the cheap plastic toys his father used to buy in Chinatown when he was a kid. His father had once shown him a breaker box in their garage, the way a man shows his son a family heirloom. “Respect electricity,” he had said. “It doesn’t care about your plan.” Marcus had nodded then, because you always nod at your father, and then he had gone back inside to his computer, where everything listened.

He opened his eyes. The light flickered again, a brief dimming like a blink. He didn’t blink back.

---

At 11:30, Priya Patel's name appeared on the screen.

His thumb hovered over the button. He waited two beats to look casual. He tapped Join.

Her video came up immediately: clean office, white wall, a glass of water without fingerprints. Priya wore a black blazer and a neutral smile, the kind she had perfected from years of hearing founders say words like traction and runway. The light in her room was soft and deliberate. It made Marcus feel like he was calling from a cave.

“Marcus,” she said, leaning forward a fraction. “Thanks for taking this so late.”

“No problem,” he said. He adjusted his glasses and made his voice warm. “Time zones are just a logistics problem.”

She smiled without laughing. “Right. Can you share your screen?”

“Absolutely.”

He clicked Share. The screen split. The app showed the demo dashboard first—sleek charts, the kind of curves that always go up and to the right. He made sure his cursor moved confidently, as if this screen were his home. “So this is the live view,” he said, because he had said similar sentences a hundred times and truth was always a gradient.

He clicked to the backend tab. The logs loaded slower than they should have. He watched the little spinner and felt his body tighten. The WiFi dropped to two bars. He didn't look at the bars. He looked at Priya's face in the corner of the screen, the way you watch someone's eyes in a negotiation.

The page loaded. Rows of timestamps appeared, a thin line of life he could pretend was real. He leaned in like he was reading something difficult.

“These are actual session pings,” he said. “You can see the spike from Asia time zones, and then the U.S. picks up.”

Priya squinted. “How many daily active users is this representing right now?”

“About fourteen hundred,” he said, and felt the lie settle into his mouth like chalk. He made the number sound considered. “We’re not massive yet, but the retention curve is improving.”

“Can you click into a random user profile?” she asked.

The question was quiet. It hit him like a rubber mallet. He stared at the list, at the generic usernames, at the paths that led to empty data. He could click into the test account. He could pull up the placeholder. He could pretend the default fields were real. He could do this.

“Sure,” he said, and his hand moved before his brain fully authorized it. He clicked a username. The profile page loaded and showed a blank photo, a default time zone, a dummy plan tier. He spoke quickly. “This is one of our early adopters in Manila—beta cohort.”

Priya nodded, her face neutral. “Okay. Are these users all sourced from the Waitlist campaign you mentioned?”

“Yes,” he said. “We see best conversion there.”

He thought about the waitlist landing page he had run ads to. He thought about the thirty-four emails he had collected. He thought about the ten who had actually signed up and the twelve that bounced. He didn't say any of that.

A low thump came from somewhere in the pipes, a water hammer hitting metal. The bathroom light flickered again. He felt the buzz run through his shoe sole, a quick shiver. He shifted his weight and heard the water slosh. The puddle had crept higher, covering the tops of his shoes now, soaking through the thin fabric until his toes felt naked.

Priya glanced down at her notes. “You mentioned partnerships with hostels and coworking spaces,” she said. “Do you have any signed LOIs?”

“Not signed,” he said, and heard how that landed. “We have verbal commitments. Thailand is a little different with paperwork, but the interest is there. The demand signal is real.”

She nodded slowly. “What’s your runway?”

The word hit him in the stomach. He could have answered with the real number and watched the call end politely. He could have answered with the big number and sounded delusional. He chose a middle lie. “Four months,” he said. “And if this check comes through, twelve.”

“Okay,” she said, and her face didn't reveal if she believed him.

He pressed on. “The key is that we’re in the field. We’re learning from the market in real time. I’m literally in a hostel right now, watching behavior.”

He imagined her glancing around her office, the clean lines, the humming AC, the stable current. He imagined her trying to picture him in Bangkok without seeing the puddle at his feet. He didn't know which picture was worse.

She tapped her pen. “What does pricing look like for the hostels?”

He swallowed. “We’re testing tiered plans. Basic is free to get adoption; premium gives them analytics and upsell tools. We can show you the pricing sheet.”

He clicked the pricing slide, the one he had built in a cafe in Chiang Mai, the one with the clean columns and the bold numbers. He remembered how it felt to design it, the certainty of choosing a price like he was naming a star. He pointed to the premium tier and said, “This is where the margin is,” like he was already there.

Priya nodded. “Okay. Keep going.”

He did. He clicked, he talked, he sold. The humidity thickened around him, the damp air pressing against his lungs. The charger cable trembled under his wrist again, a faint live thing. He moved it away from his skin and kept his voice steady. The light flickered once, then steadied. The fan on the ceiling ticked without turning.

A faint crackle came from the wall. The light flickered. For a second, his cursor lagged. Priya's eyes lifted toward the corner of her screen. “Your connection seems unstable.”

“Monsoon,” he said. He forced a laugh. “Bangkok infrastructure is… character-building.”

“It’s fine,” she said, and he could hear the effort in the polite tone. “Just try to keep the feed steady. Can you pull up the raw logs?”

He clicked another tab. The log file loaded halfway and froze. The cursor turned into a beach ball. He felt the sweat along his spine, the way the humidity and his own adrenaline mingled until the back of his shirt felt glued to him.

He moved the mouse. Nothing.

He whispered, “Come on,” to the screen. It stayed frozen.

He glanced down at the charger cable. The brick's light was still green. He tightened his grip on the mouse and waited. The spinner moved again, a reluctant crawl. The log loaded, jagged lines of time stamps that made no sense even to him.

“These are raw pings from the last hour,” he said. “We can parse them into cohorts if needed.”

“Do you have a dashboard that shows cohort retention by week?” Priya asked.

He did, but it wasn't connected to anything. He could bring it up anyway. He could keep moving. He could keep talking. He clicked. The dashboard loaded, and for a moment he forgot that it was fake. It was so clean, so decisive, so what he had always wanted his life to be.

He felt the charger cable twitch under his fingers. The movement was slight, almost a thought, but it traveled up his wrist like a cat waking. The tingle stayed there, a quiet buzz under his skin. He flexed his hand, then put it back on the mouse.

Priya was still watching. “Okay,” she said. “This is helpful. We need to see actual usage logs for the full week. If you can send those by tomorrow morning, we can proceed.”

“Absolutely,” he said.

She nodded once. “Also, one more thing. Are you able to turn your camera on? It’s always easier to build trust when we see each other.”

He froze.

Behind him, in the mirror above the sink, he could see himself: damp hair, eyes too bright, the blue-light glasses reflecting the screen like a mask. The bathroom behind him looked small and mean, the tile stained, the wall cracked. He imagined her seeing the sign on the door. He imagined her seeing the puddle. He imagined the look on her face as she processed a founder doing a late-night call from a hostel bathroom with a DANGER sign in the background.

“My camera's acting up,” he said. He kept his voice casual. “I can jump on video tomorrow.”

Priya held his gaze for a beat too long. Then she nodded. “Okay. Please send the logs. If they look good, we can schedule a follow-up.”

“Great,” he said, and he meant it as much as he could.

“Thanks, Marcus.” She smiled once, a professional curve. Then the call ended.

---

The screen went dark, the little window gone. The bathroom was suddenly too quiet, the rain outside a muffled roar. Marcus stared at the reflection of his own face in the black laptop screen. The green light on the charger brick seemed brighter now, like a small eye.

He checked his phone. It had climbed to eleven percent. The number felt insulting. He needed fifty. He needed eighty. He needed a battery that could outlast a lie.

He looked at the outlet. The plate was warm when he touched it, warm enough to make him jerk back, the heat weirdly intimate. He pressed his finger to it again, more gently, as if testing a fever. The warmth seeped into his fingertip. A faint tingle buzzed along his nail bed, a tight, fizzing pulse.

Static, he told himself. The air was humid. It was just the air.

He unplugged the phone and set it on the sink, then reached for the adapter. The plastic was slightly soft, as if it had been left in a car on a hot day. He looked down and saw a thin, melted ridge along the edge of the brick where the heat had bitten it. It smelled like cheap plastic and burnt sugar.

He should have unplugged everything right then. He should have left. He should have done a hundred other things. Instead, he stood there, still, listening to the low hum inside the wall, the way you listen to a server room when the fans change pitch.

He thought about Priya's request. He thought about the logs he didn't have. He thought about the time it would take to fake them. He thought about the time he didn't have. He thought about the money in his account. He thought about his mother asking if he was okay, his sister's text, the weight of the word okay pressing on him from both sides.

He checked his phone again. Eleven percent. Lina had sent another message, a short one that only made the earlier ones heavier: “Please call.” He thumbed a reply, erased it, typed again. “Can’t talk. Big call.” He deleted that too. Anything he wrote would feel like a lie, and he was already drowning in those.

The Whoop band buzzed on his wrist, a notification about elevated stress. He swiped it away without reading. Even his biometrics were lecturing him now. He imagined the app classifying his current state: adrenergic, poor recovery, high strain. He imagined a little red line on a chart, a performance dashboard for his own unraveling.

He opened @HostelReaper without thinking. The latest post was a close-up of a travel adapter resting on wet tile. The caption read: “If the floor’s a mirror, don’t trust the outlet. #StayGrounded.” He stared at it until the screen dimmed. He told himself it was just a social account, just another person monetizing fear. He told himself he was not the kind of person who took advice from an anonymous feed. He told himself the many other outlets he'd used had never killed him. He told himself the roulette table had never paid him nothing but losses.

A hand jiggled the door handle. The lock shuddered. “Occupied,” he called, his voice higher than he wanted. Someone laughed in the hallway and tried the handle again, then left with a muttered curse. The sound of wet feet slapped away down the corridor. The bathroom felt smaller after that, the door thinner, the wall more fragile.

He stared at his hands. The tendons stood out under his skin. A faint scent of burnt plastic lingered on his fingers, sweet and ugly. He thought of his mother covering outlets with beige plastic caps when he was a kid, the little safety plugs he had once pulled out with a butter knife because he wanted to see what the holes did. He remembered the lecture that followed, his father's voice, calm and firm, about how some lessons only get taught once. He had shrugged then, because there were always other lessons and he was already good at learning them.

He reopened his laptop. He reopened the backend. He pulled the logs and saved them, even though they were thin and full of ghosts. He dragged them into an email and typed a subject line: “NomadSync - Usage Logs (Week 32).” He hovered over Send. The WiFi wavered. He looked at the bars. Two. One. Three. It pulsed like a heart out of rhythm.

He hit Send. The progress bar crawled. He stared at it until the little circle completed and the email whooshed away. Relief arrived like a small flood. He leaned back against the wall and felt the damp paint cool his spine.

A knock sounded on the door.

“Marcus?” Bee's voice. She didn't sound angry. She sounded tired.

He straightened. “Yeah?”

“Do not use outlet,” she said through the door. “Please. It is bad tonight. More bad than before.”

“I'm done,” he said. He didn't know why he lied. He was still plugged in.

There was a pause. “Okay,” she said. A soft shuffle of footsteps receding.

He stared at the door. He imagined Bee on the other side, her hand on the doorframe, listening to the small, human sounds of someone doing something stupid. He imagined her going back to the desk, back to her phone, back to her quiet acceptance of other people's risks.

He imagined her telling Khun Prasit tomorrow, if there was a tomorrow, that she had warned the guest again. He imagined the shrug. He imagined his own shrug. He imagined the chain of shrugs that held the world together.

He pulled the adapter out. The outlet snapped with a tiny blue flash. It was so small he could have convinced himself he didn't see it. The light in the bathroom flickered, then steadied. The hum dropped, but it didn't disappear. It lived in the wall, just under hearing, like a distant engine.

He packed his laptop and shoved the charger into his bag. The puddle around his shoes had warmed. When he lifted his foot, the water tugged at it like a hand. He stepped carefully, the tiles slick, the air thick with bleach and electricity. He turned off the light and opened the door.

The hallway was empty. The emergency light still glowed sickly green, even though the power had returned an hour ago. The light cast shadows that made the corridor look longer than it was. The fan outside the bathroom pushed a ribbon of damp air against his face, cool and useless.

He walked back to the dorm, the laptop pressed against his ribs like a heart. The rain outside had intensified; he could hear it slapping against the tin awning in wild, syncopated patterns. The building felt like it was breathing, expanding and contracting with each gust. He passed the stairwell window and saw water streaming down the glass in thick, uneven lines.

In the dorm, the others were asleep, their bodies tangled in sheets, their phones glowing faintly on the nightstand like tiny rectangles of faith. Marcus climbed into his bunk and stared at the ceiling. The stain above him had spread. It looked like an island, dark edges creeping outward.

He checked his phone. Twelve percent. It would be fifteen by morning if he left it alone. Fifteen was still nowhere near enough to answer a call, to send logs, to keep a tether alive.

He set an alarm for 6:00 AM. He told himself he'd go downstairs early, before anyone was awake, just to top up. Ten minutes. A quick draw. A calculated risk. He told himself it would be the last time.

He did the math in his head anyway, the way he always did. If the battery drained three percent overnight, he'd wake at nine. If he charged for fifteen minutes, he could be at twenty, which would buy him an hour of tether, enough to polish the logs, maybe enough to reply to Lina, maybe enough to be a person. It was ridiculous, budgeting minutes of electricity like it was runway, but he had always been good at pretending math could cancel out fear.

Outside, thunder rolled across the city in a slow, metallic growl. The light in the hallway flickered in time with it, a strobe he could feel through the wall. He imagined the water downstairs pooling higher, the outlet dark and humming to itself. He imagined Bee at the desk, head down, pretending not to listen to the building breathe.

The hostel's plumbing groaned. Somewhere, a gecko clicked. The fluorescent light in the hallway flickered twice, then steadied. Marcus closed his eyes and tried to sleep. In the dark, the low hum from downstairs seemed louder, as if the building had a pulse of its own.

He felt that hum in his teeth. He felt it in his wrists. He felt it in the small part of him that had learned, once, to trust alarms.

He turned over and pressed the phone under his pillow like a talisman. The rain kept falling. The outlet waited.
