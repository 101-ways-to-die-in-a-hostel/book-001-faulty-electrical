# Chapter 14: Dead Zone

Marcus slipped out of the bunk at 4:11 AM, the kind of hour where mistakes feel like strategies.

The dorm was a damp cave of breath and metal. Someone snored in the rhythm of a malfunctioning fan. A phone alarm chirped once and died. Marcus moved with the exaggerated care of a man who was not supposed to be awake, his laptop under one arm like contraband, his dead phone in the other hand like a fragile organ he was transporting for surgery. He could have waited. He could have slept. He could have done anything else. But Priya’s message sat in his sent folder like a fuse, and his battery was a flat line.

He told himself it was better to go now, before Bee’s shift started, before anyone could see him, before the building fully woke and the current did whatever it did when it felt observed. He told himself that doing something stupid at dawn was the kind of grit investors liked, the founder sleeping under his desk, the hustler in the bathroom. He told himself a lot of things.

The hallway light flickered as he stepped out, a quick nervous blink. The sign on the bathroom door was still there, the red tape frayed at the edges like a scab someone had picked at in the night. DANGER — DO NOT CHARGE ELECTRONICS IN THIS BATHROOM. The pen underneath still screamed NO CALLS EITHER.

He peeled the tape back with his thumb and went in.

The room was colder at night, the tile holding the rain’s memory. The puddle was high enough that it lapped gently against his shoes when he stepped in, a thin wave that chilled his toes and slid into his socks. The fluorescent light buzzed with a tired whine. The outlet plate looked darker, the scorch marks spreading in a bruise around the screws. A little bead of water clung to the exposed wire like sweat.

He set his laptop on the sink and opened it. Three bars. Relief came so fast it embarrassed him. He plugged his phone into the laptop and watched the screen glow to life at one percent. He needed the phone to tether. He needed the tether to send Priya the numbers. He needed the numbers to be true enough that he could believe them again.

He opened the Metrics document and stared at the lies he’d typed. Traction: 2,400 users. Monthly growth: 18%. Churn: 4%. It was a house of cards built from optimistic guesses and an Excel template. He had always told himself it was placeholder reality, that the numbers would catch up. Now, in a damp bathroom at dawn, they looked like the handwriting of a stranger.

He made himself edit anyway. He changed 2,400 to 1,700, as if honesty could be done by rounding down. He changed 18 to 12. He changed churn to 9 because it sounded both realistic and survivable. He stared at the page and felt the cold air move through him like a draft.

The phone ticked to two percent, then three. The charging cable warmed under his fingers. He could feel the hum in the wall, a thin, impatient vibration that seemed to make the air thicken. He felt, faintly, the familiar fizz at his soles, a soft tingle like carbonated water. He tried to shift his weight without sloshing the puddle. The water slid around his feet anyway, indifferent.

He hit send on the updated one-pager and watched the progress bar creep to sixty, then hang. The WiFi bars dipped to two. His stomach tightened. He had almost forgotten to worry about the WiFi. It was always something.

He held his breath. The bar moved again, a reluctant crawl to seventy. He did not touch the charger. He did not move. The light flickered once, a brief stutter. The outlet crackled a thin, dry pop from inside the wall. He flinched and steadied himself.

The bar hit one hundred. The email whooshed away.

He exhaled. He checked his phone. Four percent. He should leave. He should leave.

He reached for the cord anyway. His body moved before his brain could finish the lecture, a reflex as automatic as tapping refresh. He imagined Priya in a conference room, her laptop at full brightness, her phone on a wireless charger, her world built on stable current and a different kind of fear. He imagined the thin percentage number beside her name on his screen and felt the urge to pad it, to make it look less desperate, to make it look like a person with options.

A tingle snapped up his fingers, a quick pinprick like static, and he jerked back. The hum in the room rose for a second and then fell again. He laughed once, short and embarrassed, as if his body had told a joke he didn’t understand.

He unplugged the phone from the laptop and slipped it into his pocket. He closed the laptop and lifted it off the sink, the underside slick with condensation. A drop of water slid down the lid and splashed onto his wrist. He felt the cold and then, behind it, a faint metallic warmth.

He backed out of the bathroom. The hallway was empty. The sign flapped once as the door swung shut. He did not look at it.

By seven, the hostel was awake and already tired. The common room smelled like instant coffee and wet shoes. Bee sat behind the desk with her chin in her hand, scrolling through something on her phone that looked like a spreadsheet but could have been a soap opera. She glanced up when Marcus came down, and her eyes went right to the damp cuffs of his pants.

“You go in,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

He opened his mouth to deny it, then closed it. “Just to send a file,” he said. He tried to sound casual, as if he were talking about brushing his teeth. “I didn’t plug in.”

Bee’s expression didn’t change. “The water is higher,” she said. “The wall is wet inside. It is dangerous now.”

“I was careful,” he said. He hated the way the words landed, small and petulant.

She set her phone down. “Careful is not a shield,” she said. She gestured toward the ceiling. “Sometimes the electricity finds you, not the other way.”

He wanted to argue, to put things in terms she would understand, to explain the path of least resistance, the way current required a closed circuit, the way he had insulated himself with rubber soles and a laptop case. He wanted to say the word GFCI like it was a spell. He wanted to say a lot of things that would make him feel in control. He said, “I’m fine,” instead.

Bee sighed and lifted her eyes toward the hallway. “Boss come today,” she said. “He see the leak.”

“Khun Prasit?”

She nodded. “He say he fix the drain. Maybe. He say he buy new light. Maybe.”

“Fix the wiring?” Marcus asked.

Bee gave him a look that was a laugh without sound. “After high season,” she said. “Always after.”

He felt a small flare of anger, not at her but at the way the whole building seemed to take responsibility and slide it around like a coin. He understood the money problem. He understood the calculus of postponing. He understood it too well. It was his own calculus mirrored back at him: later, later, later.

A backpacker in elephant pants approached the desk, dripping rainwater onto the tile. “The shower on the third floor bit me,” she said, rubbing her forearm. “Like a shock.”

Bee nodded without surprise. “No charging in bathroom,” she said. “You know.”

The girl blinked. “I wasn’t charging. I was just taking a shower.”

Bee’s expression tightened. “Then maybe no shower,” she said, dry. The girl laughed and walked away, as if it was a joke.

Marcus watched her go. He pictured a shower in the third-floor bathroom, the water hitting tile, the wire in the wall humming. He pictured his own feet in the puddle downstairs. The line between them felt thin and arbitrary, like a business decision.

In the common room, someone had taped a printed meme above the router: a cartoon outlet with a skull face and the caption “GOOD NIGHT.” Marcus didn’t know if it was meant to be funny or a warning disguised as a joke. A Brit in a tank top laughed and took a photo. “This place is savage,” he said to his friend. His friend replied, “Bangkok is savage,” as if the city were to blame for the building’s wiring. Marcus wanted to explain the difference between climate and negligence, between monsoon and maintenance, but no one was asking for a lecture.

He pulled up @HostelReaper on his phone out of habit. The latest post was a close-up of a wet outlet with a caption: “Every hostel has a heartbeat. Some of them are arrhythmic.” The comments were laughing emojis and people tagging their friends. He stared longer than he meant to, then closed the app as if it could see him back.

He went upstairs and tried to sleep, but his body refused. His phone was at six percent. The dorm outlet sputtered when he tried to charge it, the little light on the brick blinking once and then dying. He tried again. Nothing. The outlet had joined the rest of the building in quiet revolt.

He sat on his bunk and watched his phone slowly lose percent with nothing happening. He thought about Priya reading his updated one-pager in her morning. He thought about her reaching for a coffee, a clean outlet, a quiet office. He imagined her saying his name out loud in a room full of people who had never stood in a puddle to send a file. He wanted, fiercely, to be in that room.

By late morning, the monsoon returned with a hard, angry burst. The windows rattled. The hallway lights flickered in a quick sequence like a warning. In the common room, Khun Prasit arrived with a man in a damp collared shirt carrying a toolbox. The owner was smaller than Marcus expected, compact and careful, his smile practiced and thin. He greeted Bee and ignored the guests. Marcus watched from the stairwell, half-hidden.

Prasit glanced toward the bathroom door, the red tape, the sign. He said something in Thai to the man with the toolbox, who nodded and walked toward the back.

Marcus wandered down, pretending to look at the travel tips board. “Are you fixing it?” he asked, and tried to make the question sound like curiosity instead of desperation.

Prasit turned, surprised that a guest had a voice. His English was smooth. “We make small repair,” he said. “Drain, light. The rain brings trouble.”

“What about the wiring?” Marcus asked.

Prasit smiled, a tight curve. “Wiring is old. But it works. People just need to follow rules.”

He gestured to the sign. It was a neat deflection: if something went wrong, it would be a matter of guest negligence, not his wall. Marcus felt the small, immediate indignation of someone who was being blamed for a problem he had already chosen to ignore.

The man with the toolbox emerged from the bathroom and said something in Thai. Prasit frowned. “Water in wall,” he said, turning back to Marcus as if continuing a casual conversation. “Rain come sideways. It is Bangkok.”

He shrugged, a gesture that said: the city is wet, what can you do.

Marcus wanted to say: fix it. He wanted to say: this is a murder waiting for an opportunity. He wanted to say: your sign is not a circuit breaker. He said, “Thanks,” because he had learned that anger here only made him feel lonelier.

The toolbox man rolled a small fan into the hallway and pointed it at the bathroom door. It pushed wet air in lazy circles. A second man arrived with a coil of electrical tape. They removed the outlet plate for a moment, revealing the corroded wire behind it, and Marcus felt his stomach dip. The wire looked older and greener than he had imagined, frayed like a seaweed strand. One of the men wrapped it in tape, as if bandaging a wound. He replaced the plate and patted the wall with his palm, satisfied.

Marcus watched, amazed at how small the fix was. The kind of fix you could do in five minutes to keep the day moving. The kind of fix that made a problem look solved without changing the underlying risk. He knew that fix. He had built his company out of those.

When the men left, the sign remained. The puddle crept back toward the door as if it had been waiting.

In the afternoon, Priya replied.

“Thanks for the update. Can we see actual user activity logs or screenshots by tonight?”

Marcus stared at the message until the words felt like they were in a different language. Actual logs. Screenshots. Evidence. Proof. He had always been good at storytelling. He had always believed the story could become the thing. He did not have logs. He had an app no one used and a backend full of test data. He had a demo he could stage if he found the right lighting and the right lie.

He needed the app to work. He needed to connect to the server, to pull anything that looked like real activity. He needed WiFi that wouldn’t die. He needed a battery that could hold long enough to fake a heartbeat.

He went downstairs with his laptop, planning to sit near the router and pray. The router’s tired green light blinked at him, a slow, indifferent pulse. The signal dropped twice in one minute. The app backend wouldn’t load. A tiny error message appeared like a judgment: Connection timed out.

He checked the cafe. Power out. The handwritten sign had a new addition: CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. He looked back at the hostel and felt the math rearrange itself, the same variables, the same conclusion.

He hesitated in front of the bathroom door. The red tape had been replaced with a new strip, bright and smooth, as if the building were trying to renew its promise. He peeled it back and stepped inside anyway.

The puddle was even higher, a shallow inch of water that sent a slow wave to the walls when he entered. The air smelled of wet plaster and ozone. The light buzzed more loudly than before, a high, thin whine. The outlet plate looked cleaner with the new tape, but the scorch around it had darkened, a brown halo that bled into the tile.

He set his laptop on the sink and opened the app. Three bars. Relief flooded him, quick and guilty. He tethered to his phone without thinking. The battery dropped to seven percent. He watched the backend load, slow and reluctant. A list of users appeared. Most of them were labeled TEST USER. He clicked a dashboard and took a screenshot of a graph he had made months ago, the one that looked like a gentle upward trend. He cropped out the axis labels that revealed the dates.

He told himself he would replace the lies later, that the ends would justify the means because the ends were survival. He told himself that every founder did this, that the difference between him and the people on stage was just timing and resources. He told himself he wasn’t a fraud, just pre-revenue.

The WiFi stuttered. The screen froze. The graph went grey. He cursed under his breath and clicked refresh.

The light flickered hard, a quick strobe that made his shadow jitter against the wall. The hum in the room rose. He felt the tingle in his soles, stronger now, a fizz that ran up his calves like a climbing vine. He shifted his weight to his heels. The tingle intensified, as if the floor were reaching for him.

He lifted his feet one at a time, trying to find a dry patch. There was none. The puddle had won.

The backend loaded again. He took three more screenshots and saved them to his desktop. The phone battery dropped to six. He needed to send the files to Priya. He needed to charge, just a little, just to keep the tether alive.

He pulled the charger cable out of his bag. He stared at the outlet. The new tape around the wire looked like a fresh bandage. He imagined the men from earlier, their hands moving quickly, their tape sealing nothing. He thought of Bee’s warning. He thought of his mother’s voice. He thought of Priya waiting in a clean office, her screen glowing, her patience shrinking.

He plugged in.

A blue flash flared behind the outlet plate, bright enough to make him blink. The light flickered in sharp bursts. The hum became a scream. He felt the current in his legs like a sudden, hard grip. His muscles seized for a heartbeat, a brief, involuntary lock that made his jaw clench. Then the sensation receded, leaving a buzzing aftertaste in his knees.

He stood still, breath shallow, staring at the charger light as it turned green. The phone buzzed and ticked up to seven percent. He felt the buzz in his pocket and hated how relieved it made him.

The smell of burning plastic sharpened in the air. He could taste metal, copper on his tongue. His hands were sweaty. He wiped them on his shorts and felt the dampness spread.

“Okay,” he whispered, and this time it sounded less like a joke.

He yanked the adapter out. The light steadied. The hum dropped. The tingling in his legs faded, but his muscles stayed tight, as if his body didn’t fully trust the truce.

He stepped backward, careful not to slip, and made it to the hallway. The air there felt almost dry by comparison. He closed the door and heard the sign’s tape whisper against the wall.

At the desk, Bee looked up. She saw his wet cuffs and the laptop clutched to his chest. Her face was tired and flat.

“You felt it,” she said.

He opened his mouth to deny it, then didn’t. “It was just a little,” he said.

She shook her head slowly. “The little is the warning,” she said. “Next is not little.”

He wanted to say he understood. He wanted to say he would stop. He wanted to say anything that would make her look less afraid. He said, “I have to send some files,” because it was the only line he seemed to have.

Bee watched him for a long beat, then looked away. “Mai pen rai,” she said, but it didn’t sound like forgiveness. It sounded like resignation.

He went upstairs and sent the screenshots to Priya, his fingers shaking as he attached the files. The email went through. He leaned back and waited for the response that would decide his life, or at least his week.

The response didn’t come.

By night, the rain turned vicious. It hammered the roof and made the windows tremble. The hallway lights flickered in a slow, angry rhythm. The power cut out twice, each time returning with a bright surge that made the bulbs pop and the air smell faintly of hot dust. In the dorm, someone muttered a prayer and another person laughed too loudly.

Marcus lay on his bunk with his phone on his chest, the battery at eight percent and falling. He watched the screen dim, the way a heartbeat monitor dims when the patient drifts. He refreshed his inbox until it stopped making sense. No response from Priya. No response from anyone. He watched the rain through the window, the wires outside shaking under the weight of water.

At ten, the power died again. The fan stopped. The room went still. The only sound was the rain and the distant thrum of the city. Marcus’s phone buzzed low and then went dark. He stared at the black screen and felt the familiar panic rise, the urge to solve, to fix, to move.

He could wait for the power to return. He could sleep. He could let the night be the night. He could also go downstairs and charge just enough to wake the phone, just enough to see if Priya had written back.

He sat up.

The dorm was dark, lit only by the emergency exit sign’s green glow. He could see the outline of the door, the metal bunks, the damp stain on the ceiling. He could hear his own breathing. He could hear the low hum in the walls even with the power out, a faint, animal noise that made him think of something alive in the building, something patient.

He climbed down quietly and slipped out into the hallway. The hallway light flickered on for a second and then died. The red tape on the bathroom sign glowed faintly in the emergency light. He put his hand on the door and paused.

In the dark, he could hear water moving inside, a soft, steady lapping. The bathroom smelled of ozone even through the crack. The air felt damp and metallic, as if the building were sweating.

He told himself he would not plug in. He told himself he would just stand at the doorway, like Bee had suggested, just enough for one bar of signal, just enough to see if there was a message. He told himself he was being cautious, careful, responsible.

He pushed the door open and stepped into the black.

The floor was colder than he expected. The puddle swallowed his shoes, the water climbing up his ankles with a slow, deliberate touch. He felt the hair on his arms rise. He set his laptop on the sink and opened it. The screen lit the room in a dull blue glow. The WiFi bars climbed to three.

For a moment, he thought about his mother asleep in Cupertino, the refrigerator humming its safe, boring hum. He thought about Lina’s text—“Please call me”—that he still hadn’t answered. He thought about the girl in elephant pants, laughing off the shock like it was a party trick. He thought about the way he had always believed that risk was something you could quantify if you had the right spreadsheet. Standing in that water, he could feel the math dissolve into the air.

He saw his inbox populate. Still nothing from Priya. He stared at the empty thread and felt the shape of failure settle into his chest.

The light in the hallway flickered back to life, and with it the bathroom light buzzed weakly, a dim, shivering glow. The outlet plate looked like a dark mouth in the wall. The scorch marks were wider now, the tape from earlier already peeling at one corner.

His phone was dead. He needed to wake it if he wanted to hear a reply. He told himself: just a minute. Just a few percent. Just enough to see a notification light if it came.

He pulled the charger from his bag.

The adapter hovered a breath away from the outlet. The water around his feet was still. The hum in the wall deepened, a low, anticipatory note. He could taste metal at the back of his tongue. He could feel his heart beating in his fingers.

He glanced at the sign on the door, the red tape, the word DANGER glowing faintly in the low light.

He looked back at the outlet and, in the dim buzz of the bulb, watched a small blue spark flicker behind the cracked plate.

He froze, the adapter held midair, and realized the building was no longer warning him. It was daring him.

In the puddle, a faint ripple spread from his ankles as if the water had flinched too. He held his breath and listened to the hum, waiting to see which of them would move first.
